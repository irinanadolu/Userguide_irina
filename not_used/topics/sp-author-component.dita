  <body>
    <p>The <i>Author Component</i> was designed as a subset of <ph keyref="product"/> that can be
      integrated into another application under the terms of the <ph keyref="product"/> SDK
      agreement to provide functionality for editing and authoring XML documents. The component can
      be embedded in a third-party standalone Java application or customized as a Java Web Applet to
      provide WYSIWYG-like XML editing directly in your web browser. </p>
    <p>The <i>Author Component</i> startup project for <term>Java Swing</term> integrations is
      available online as a Maven archetype on the <ph keyref="product"/> website. More information
      about the setup can be found on the <xref
        href="http://www.oxygenxml.com/oxygen_sdk.html#oXygen_component" format="html"
        scope="external">oXygen SDK page</xref>.</p>
