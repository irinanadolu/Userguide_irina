    <note>The WebHelp Classic Mobile system was deprecated as of version 19.0. It is recommended
      that you use the more recent <xref
        href="webhelp-responsive-description.dita#webhelp-responsive-description"><b>WebHelp
          Responsive</b> system</xref> for a flexible mobile variant.</note>
    <p><b>WebHelp</b> is a form of online help that consists of a series of web pages (XHTML
      format). Its advantages include platform independence, ability to update content continuously,
      and it can be viewed using a regular web browser. The <ph keyref="product"/> WebHelp system
      includes several variants to suit your specific needs. The <b>WebHelp Classic Mobile</b>
      variant works on multiple platforms (Android, iOS, BlackBerry, Windows Mobile) and is
      specially designed for mobile devices when feedback from users is not necessary. It is
      available for DocBook and DITA document types. The functionality of the desktop WebHelp
      Classic layout is preserved, it is organized in an intuitive layout, and offers table of
      contents, search capabilities, and index navigation.</p>
