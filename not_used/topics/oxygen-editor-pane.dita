  <title>The Editor Pane</title>
  <body>
    <p>The <term>editor pane</term>, or simply the <term>editor</term>, is where you edit your
      documents opened or created by the <ph keyref="product"/>. You know the document is associated
      with <ph keyref="product"/> from the special icon displayed in the editor title bar which has
      the same graphic pattern painted with different colors for different types of documents. </p>
    <p>This pane has three different modes of displaying and editing the content of a document
      available as different tabs at the bottom left margin of the editor panel:
        <uicontrol>Text</uicontrol> mode, <uicontrol>Grid</uicontrol> Mode,
        <uicontrol>Author</uicontrol> mode (CSS based tag-less editor).</p>
