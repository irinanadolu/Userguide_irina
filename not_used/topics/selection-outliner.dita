    <p>The Outline view can also be used to search for a specific tag location and contents in the
      edited document. Intuitively, by selecting with the left mouse button the desired tag in the
      Outline view, the document is scrolled to the position of the selected tag. Moreover, the tag
      contents are selected in the document, making it easy to notice the part of the document
      contained by that specific tag and furthermore to easily copy and paste the tag's contents in
      other parts of the document or in other documents. </p>
    <p>You can double click the tag in the <uicontrol>Outline</uicontrol> tree to move the focus in
      the editor.</p>
    <p>You can also use the filter text field search to look for a particular tag name in the
        <uicontrol>Outline</uicontrol> tree.</p>
