    <p>The <uicontrol>Track Changes</uicontrol> feature is able to keep track of changes you make to
      attributes in a document. If the <xref
        href="callouts-preferences-page.dita#callouts-preferences-page"
          ><uicontrol>Callouts</uicontrol> support is enabled</xref>, all the attribute changes are
      presented as callouts in the document you are editing. The changes are also presented in the
        <xref href="review-view.dita#review-view"><uicontrol>Review</uicontrol> view</xref> and
        <xref href="author-attributes-view.dita#author-attributes-view"
          ><uicontrol>Attributes</uicontrol> view</xref>.</p>
    <p>When you copy a fragment that contains tracked attribute changes, the following is possible:<ul>
        <li>If you perform the copy operation with <uicontrol>Track Changes</uicontrol> enabled, all
          the attribute changes in the fragment are accepted.</li>
        <li>If you perform the copy operation with <uicontrol>Track Changes</uicontrol> disabled,
          the fragment holds the attribute changes inside it.</li>
      </ul></p>
    <p>When you paste a fragment that contains tracked attribute changes, the following is possible:<ul>
        <li>If you perform the paste operation with <uicontrol>Track Changes</uicontrol> enabled,
          the changes are accepted before the paste operation.</li>
        <li>If you perform the paste operation with <uicontrol>Track Changes</uicontrol> disabled,
          the changes are pasted in the document.</li>
      </ul></p>
