    <p>Entire XML elements can be moved or copied in the edited document using only the mouse in the
        <uicontrol>Outline</uicontrol> view with drag-and-drop operations. Several drag and drop
      actions are possible:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If you drag an XML element in the <uicontrol>Outline</uicontrol> view and drop it on
        another one in the same panel then the dragged element will be moved after the drop target
        element.</li>
      <li>If you hold the mouse pointer over the drop target for a short time before the drop then
        the drop target element will be expanded first and the dragged element will be moved inside
        the drop target element after its opening tag.</li>
      <li>You can also drop an element before or after another element if you hold the mouse pointer
        towards the upper or lower part of the targeted element. A marker will indicate whether the
        drop will be performed before or after the target element.</li>
      <li>If you hold down the <uicontrol><shortcut>(Ctrl (Command on OS X))</shortcut></uicontrol>
        key after dragging, there will be performed a copy operation instead of a move one.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The drag and drop action in the <uicontrol>Outline</uicontrol> view can be <xref
        href="preferences-view.dita">disabled and enabled from a Preferences page.</xref>
