  <body>
    <p>Suppose you need to produce your publication for a German audience. In this case, you would
      want the text from the headers and footers to be translated to German. </p>
    <p>To achieve this, set the <xmlatt>xml:lang</xmlatt> attribute on the root of your DITA map to
        <codeph>de_de</codeph>.</p>
    <note type="warning">The <codeph>default.language</codeph> transformation parameter is not taken
      into account.</note>
