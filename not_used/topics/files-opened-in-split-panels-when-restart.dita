      <p>When I close the <ph keyref="product"/> application with multiple files open and then
        restart it, every file opens in a split panel of the editing area instead of a tab sharing
        with the other opened files the same editing area which organizes the editors in a tabbed
        pane. I want to have the files arranged as a tabbed pane as they used to be arranged before
        closing the <ph keyref="product"/> application.</p>

      <p>This happens sometimes when several files are opened automatically on startup. It is a
        problem of the JIDE docking views library used in <ph keyref="product"/> for docking and
        floating views. The workaround is to use the <uicontrol>Reset Layout</uicontrol> action from
        the <uicontrol>Window</uicontrol> menu.</p>
