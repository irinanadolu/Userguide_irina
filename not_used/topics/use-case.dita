    Integrate the <ph keyref="authorComponent"/> with SharePoint<?oxy_comment_end?></title>
  <body>
    <p>The <ph keyref="authorComponent"/> can be embedded in a SharePoint site as a Java applet.
      This is a simple and convenient way for you to retrieve, open, and save XML or XML-related
      documents stored on your company's SharePoint server, directly from your web browser. </p>
    <p>For example, suppose that you are working on a team project that uses the DITA <xref
        keyref="glossentry_framework"><term>framework</term></xref> for writing product
      documentation and you have the <xref keyref="glossentry_ditamap"><term>DITA maps</term></xref>
      and topics stored on a SharePoint repository. By using a custom defined action from the
      contextual menu of a document, you can easily open it in the <ph keyref="authorComponent"/>
      applet that is embedded in your SharePoint Documents page.</p>
    <p>You can embed the applet either on a site that is located on a standalone SharePoint server,
      or on your company Microsoft Office 365 account.</p>
    <p>This example can be used as a starting point for other CMS integrations.</p>
