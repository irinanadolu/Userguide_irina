  <title>XSLT/XQuery Performance Profiling Overview</title><?oxy_comment_end?>
  <body>
    <p>Whether you are trying to identify a performance issue that is causing your production
      XSLT/XQuery transformation to not meet customer expectations or you are trying to proactively
      identify issues prior to deploying your XSLT/XQuery transformation, using the XSLT/XQuery
      profiler feature is essential to helping you save time and ultimately ensure a better
      performing, more scalable XSLT/XQuery transformation.</p>
    <p>The XSLT/XQuery profiling feature can use any available XSLT/XQuery processors that could be
      used for debugging and it is available from the debugging <xref
        keyref="glossentry_perspective"><term>perspective</term></xref>.</p>
    <p>Enabling and disabling the profiler is controlled by the <xref
        href="debug-control-toolbar.dita#debug-control-toolbar/profiling"><uicontrol><image
            href="../img/Profiling16.png" id="image_orn_y2n_wr"/>/<image
            href="../img/ProfilingSelected16.png"/> Profiler</uicontrol> button</xref> from the
        <xref href="debug-control-toolbar.dita">debugger control toolbar</xref>. The XSLT/XQuery
      profiler is off by default. This option is not available during a debugger session so you
      should set it before starting the transformation.</p>
