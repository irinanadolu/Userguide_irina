  <body>
    <p>One of the main challenges when integrating the <ph keyref="authorComponent"/> in your
      SharePoint site is to avoid authenticating twice when opening a document resource stored in
      your SharePoint repository.</p>
    <p>You have already signed in when you started the SharePoint session, but the <ph
        keyref="authorComponent"/> is not aware of your current session. In this case every time the
        <ph keyref="authorComponent"/> is accessing a document it will ask you to input your
      credentials again.</p>
    <p>As a possible solution, do not execute HTTP requests directly from the Java code, but forward
      them to the web browser that hosts the <ph keyref="authorComponent"/>, because it is aware of
      the current user session (authentication cookies).</p>
    <p>To open documents stored on your SharePoint repository, register your own protocol handler to
      the JVM. An implemented handler for both <i>http</i> and <i>https</i> protocols forwards the
      HTTP requests to a JavaScript <codeph>XMLHttpRequest</codeph> object. This way, the browser
      that executes the JavaScript code is responsible for handling the authentication to the
      SharePoint site.</p>
    <p>To install this handler, add the following line to your Java applet code (for example, in the
        <codeph>ro.sync.ecss.samples.AuthorComponentSampleApplet</codeph>
      class):<codeblock outputclass="language-java">URL.setURLStreamHandlerFactory(new 
  ro.sync.net.protocol.http.handlers.CustomURLStreamHandlerFactory(this));</codeblock></p>
    <p> To allow JavaScript calls from your Java applet code, set the MAYSCRIPT attribute to
        <codeph>true</codeph> in the <codeph>&lt;applet></codeph> element embedded in you HTML
      page:<codeblock outputclass="language-xml">&lt;applet width="100%" height="600"
  code="ro.sync.ecss.samples.AuthorComponentSampleApplet"
  name="authorComponentAppletName" id="authorComponentApplet" 
  MAYSCRIPT="true">
    .....
&lt;/applet></codeblock></p>
    <note type="tip">If the <ph keyref="authorComponent"/> is not working, or you cannot open
      documents from your SharePoint repository, enable the debugging tools that come bundled with
      your Web Browser or the Java Console from your operating system to try to identify the cause
      of the problem.</note>
