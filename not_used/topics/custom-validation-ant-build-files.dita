    Validation Engine for Ant Build Files<?oxy_comment_end?></title>
  <body>
    <p>If you need to validate an Ant build file with a validation engine that is different from the
      built-in engine, you can configure external engines as custom Ant validation engines in the
        <ph keyref="product"/> preferences. After a custom validation engine is <xref
        href="../../topics/preferences-editor-custom-validation.dita">properly configured</xref>, it can be
      applied on the current document by selecting it from the list of custom validation engines in
      the <uicontrol><image href="../../img/ValidateDrop.png" id="image_hwf_q1w_sr"
        />Validation</uicontrol> toolbar drop-down menu. The document is validated against the
      schema declared in the document.</p>
