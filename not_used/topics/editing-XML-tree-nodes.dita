    <p>A <xref href="checking-xml-well-formedness.dita">Well-Formed XML document</xref> can be
      viewed and edited in <ph keyref="product"/> also as a tree of XML elements. This is possible
      in the Tree Editor perspective, available from <menucascade>
        <uicontrol>Tools</uicontrol>
        <uicontrol>Tree Editor</uicontrol>
      </menucascade>. The <uicontrol>Tree Editor</uicontrol> provides specially designed views,
      toolbars and an editable tree allowing you to use common tree actions, such as create/delete
      nodes, edit node names, and move nodes with drag and drop.</p>
    <p>If you want to be able to edit XML documents that are not well-formed and still have a tree
      view of the document you should use the <xref href="outliner-view.dita">Outline view</xref> in
      the Editor perspective.</p>
