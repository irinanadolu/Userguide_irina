    <p>XQuery is the query language for XML and is officially defined by <xref
        href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xquery/" scope="external" format="html">a W3C Recommendation
        document</xref>. The many benefits of XQuery include:<ul>
        <li>XQuery allows you to work in one common model no matter what type of data you are
          working with: relational, XML, or object data.</li>
        <li>XQuery is ideal for queries that must represent results as XML, to query XML stored
          inside or outside the database, and to span relational and XML sources.</li>
        <li>XQuery allows you to create many different types of XML representations of the same
          data.</li>
        <li>XQuery allows you to query both relational sources and XML sources, and create one XML
          result.</li>
      </ul></p>
