    <p>â€¦.... The reviewer then simply clicks the link or pastes the URL in their browser, and they
      will be redirected to the <ph keyref="webappProduct"/> editing page with that particular file
      open and editable.</p>
    <p>It is also possible to configure the link using the same parameters as you would if you were
        <xref href="webauthor-integrate-embedded-launch.dita#webauthor-integrate-embedded-launch"
        >embedding an <i>Edit</i> link in your web page or published output</xref>.</p>
    <p><b><u>Example:</u></b></p>
    <p>Suppose that the <ph keyref="webappProduct"/> is deployed at the following
      URL:<codeblock>http://www.example.com/oxygen-sdk-sample-webapp/</codeblock></p>
    <p>The user (John Doe) wants to edit a file (located at
        <filepath>http://www.test.com/topics/topic.xml</filepath>) in the context of a <term>DITA
        map</term> (located at <filepath>http://www.test.com/map.xml</filepath>). In this case, the
      editing URL should
        be:<codeblock>http://www.example.com/oxygen-sdk-sample-webapp/app/oxygen.html
?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.test.com%2Ftopics%2Ftopic.xml
&amp;ditamap=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.test.com%2Fmap.xml
&amp;author=John%20Doe</codeblock><note>The
        parameter values are percent encoded before being added to the editing URL.</note></p>
