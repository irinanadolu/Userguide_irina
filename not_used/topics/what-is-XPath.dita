    <p>XPath is a language for addressing specific parts of an XML document. XPath, such as the
      Document Object Model (DOM), models an XML document as a tree of nodes. An XPath expression is
      a mechanism for navigating through and selecting nodes from the XML document. An XPath
      expression is, in a way, analogous to an SQL query used to select records from a database.</p>
    <p>There are various types of nodes, including element nodes, attribute nodes, and text nodes.
      XPath defines a way to compute a string-value for each type of node.</p>
    <p>XPath defines a library of standard functions for working with strings, numbers and boolean
      expressions.</p>
    <example>
      <ul>
        <li><codeph>child::*</codeph> - Selects all children of the root node.</li>
        <li><codeph>.//name</codeph> - Selects all elements having the name "name", descendants of
          the current node.</li>
        <li><codeph>/catalog/cd[price&gt;10.80]</codeph> - Selects all the <codeph>cd</codeph>
          elements that have a price element with a value larger than 10.80.</li>
      </ul>
    </example>
