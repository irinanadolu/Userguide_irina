    <p>The most easiest method to customize the <term>WebHelp Responsive</term> output is to start
      from a built-in publishing template. After you choose one that is closest by your
      requirements, you can apply a series as tweaks. The most common cases are:</p>
    <ul id="ul_uhp_1ch_xcb">
      <li>You can produce significant results with minor CSS tweaks.</li>
      <li>set logo, favicon or copy additional resources.</li>
      <li>configure the main page appearance</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The <term>WebHelp Responsive</term> output is based upon the <i>Bootstrap</i> responsive
      front-end framework and is available for DITA document types.</p>
