    the Fonts</title>
  <body>
    <p>An important step in making sure your document is published properly in different scripts
      (languages) is choosing a font that covers the entire set of characters from that script
      (language).</p>
    <p>However, you can specify a series of font families (using the CSS
        <codeph>font-family</codeph> property) that are used as fall-backs. Once a word cannot be
      rendered using the first specified font, the next font family is tried. The following example
      uses some common fonts available on Windows to make a CSS stylesheet capable of properly
      displaying a large number of languages, from all European to Asian languages:</p>
    <codeblock outputclass="language-css">* {
	font-family: Calibri, SimSun, "Malgun Gothic";	
}</codeblock>
    <p>Assigning a font for all the elements, and not relying on <xref href="ch_basic_fonts.dita"
        >basic fonts</xref>, makes the document <xref href="ch_accessibility.dita"
        >accessible</xref>.<note>If your CSS does not assign a font to a part of your document, then
        the following sequence of fonts are used: Serif, Times, Times New Roman, Symbol, MingLiU, MS
        Mincho, Arial Unicode MS. This combination covers a wide character range, but might be
        different from what you need.</note></p>
