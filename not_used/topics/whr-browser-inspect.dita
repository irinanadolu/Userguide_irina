    CSS Inspector to Identify Content for Custom CSS File</title>
  <body>
    <p>You can use your browser's CSS inspector to identify the pertinent code in the current CSS
      files and you can even make changes directly in the CSS inspector to test the results so that
      you know exactly what content to use in your custom CSS file.</p>
    <p>In most popular browsers (such as Chrome, Firefox, and Edge), you can access the CSS
      inspector by using <uicontrol><shortcut>F12</shortcut></uicontrol> or by selecting
        <uicontrol>Inspect Element</uicontrol> (or simply <uicontrol>Inspect</uicontrol>) from the
      contextual menu.<note type="tip">When using Safari on Mac OS X, you must first enable the
        Develop menu by going to the Advanced settings and selecting <uicontrol>Show Develop menu in
          menu bar</uicontrol>. Then you can select <uicontrol>Show Web Inspector</uicontrol> from
        the Develop menu or click <uicontrol><shortcut>Command + Option +
        I</shortcut></uicontrol>.</note></p>
