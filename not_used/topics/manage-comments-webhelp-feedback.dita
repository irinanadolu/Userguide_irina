    <p>When you installed the <term>WebHelp Classic with Feedback</term> system the first time
      (assuming the <xref
        href="installation-dita-webhelp-feedback.dita#installation-dita-webhelp-feedback/create-db-note"
          ><uicontrol>Create new database structure</uicontrol> option</xref> was enabled), you
      should have been prompted to create an administrator account (or a user named
        <userinput>administrator</userinput> was created by default). As an administrator, you have
      access to manage comments posted in your feedback-enabled WebHelp Classic system. You can also
      manage the user information (such as role, status, or notification options).</p>
    <p>To manage comments and user information, follow these steps:<ol id="ol_ahq_fvj_vs">
        <li>At the bottom of each specific topic there is a <uicontrol>Comments</uicontrol>
          navigation bar and on the right side there is a <uicontrol>Log in</uicontrol> button.
          Click this button and log in with your administrator credentials. This gives you access to
          an <uicontrol>Admin Panel</uicontrol> button.</li>
        <li>Click the <uicontrol>Admin Panel</uicontrol> button to display an administration page.<p>
            <fig id="fig_xr3_mn3_xs">

            </fig>
          </p></li>

    <note type="warning">The key used for identifying the page a comment is attached to is the
      relative file path to the output page. Since the output file and folder names mirror the
      source, any change to the file name (or its folder) in the source will affect the comments
      associated with that WebHelp page. If you change the file name or path, the comment history
      for that topic will become orphaned (a change to the topic ID does not affect the comment
      history).</note>
