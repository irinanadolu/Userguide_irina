  <body>
    <p>When you install a new version of <ph keyref="product"/>, some data is preserved and some is
      overwritten. If there is a previous version of <ph keyref="product"/> already installed on
      your computer, it can coexist with the new one, which means you do not have to uninstall it. </p>
    <p>If you install over a previously installed version:</p>
    <ul id="ul_qmm_1jx_x4">
      <li>All the files from its install directory will be removed, including any modification in
          <xref keyref="glossentry_framework"><term>framework</term></xref> files, XSLT stylesheets,
          <xref keyref="glossentry_xml-catalog"><term>XML Catalogs</term></xref>, and templates. </li>
      <li>All global user preferences are preserved in the new version.</li>
      <li>All project preferences will be preserved in their project files. </li>
      <li>Any custom <xref keyref="glossentry_framework"><term>frameworks</term></xref> that were
        stored outside the installation directory (as configured in <xref
          href="framework-location.dita#framework-location"><menucascade>
            <uicontrol>Document type associations</uicontrol>
            <uicontrol>Locations</uicontrol>
          </menucascade></xref>) will be preserved and will be found by the new installation. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you install in a new directory.</p>
    <ul id="ul_g33_wkx_x4">
      <li>All the files from the old install directory will be preserved, including any modification
        in <xref keyref="glossentry_framework"><term>framework</term></xref> files, XSLT
        stylesheets, <xref keyref="glossentry_xml-catalog"><term>XML Catalogs</term></xref>, and
        templates. However, these modifications will not be automatically imported into the new
        installation.</li>
      <li>All global user preferences are preserved in the new version.</li>
      <li>All project preferences will be preserved in their project files. </li>
      <li>Any custom <xref keyref="glossentry_framework"><term>frameworks</term></xref> that were
        stored outside the installation directory (as configured in <xref
          href="framework-location.dita#framework-location"><menucascade>
            <uicontrol>Document type associations</uicontrol>
            <uicontrol>Locations</uicontrol>
          </menucascade></xref>) will be preserved and will be found by the new installation. </li>
