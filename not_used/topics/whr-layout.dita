  <shortdesc>The layout of the <b>WebHelp Responsive</b> system is platform independent and is able
    to adapt to any screen size. It is highly customizable and relies on a template mechanism that
    allows you to control the position of various functional template components to suit your
    particular requirements.</shortdesc>

    <p>You can select from several different styles of layouts (for example, by default, you can
      select either a <i>tiles</i> or <i>tree</i> style of layout). Furthermore, each
      of these layouts include a collection of skins that you can choose from, or you can
