  <body>
    <p>The following are known issues with the <ph keyref="documentumCMS"/>:<ul>
        <li>There is a known problem in the UCF Client implementation for Mac OS X from Documentum
          6.5 that prevents you from viewing or editing XML documents from the repository on Mac OS
          X. The UCF Client is the component responsible for file transfer between the repository
          and the local machine. This component is deployed automatically from the server.
          Documentum 6.6 does not exhibit this problem.<note>This issue was reproduced with
            Documentum 6.5 SP1. In Documentum 6.6 this is no longer reproducing.</note></li>
        <li>For the Documentum driver to work faster on Linux, you need to specify to the JVM to use
          a weaker random generator, instead of the very slow native implementation. This can be
          done by modifying in the <ph keyref="product"/> startup scripts (or in the
            <filepath>*.vmoptions</filepath> file) the system
          property:<codeblock outputclass="language-ini">-Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom</codeblock></li>
      </ul>
