    <p>The action from menu <menucascade>
        <uicontrol>Document</uicontrol>
        <uicontrol>File</uicontrol>
        <uicontrol>Open File at Caret </uicontrol>
      </menucascade> opens in a new panel the file with the file path at the caret position. If the
      path represents a directory path, it will be opened in system file browser. If the file does
      not exist at the specified location, the error dialog box that is displayed contains a
        <uicontrol>Create new file</uicontrol> button that starts the <uicontrol>New
        document</uicontrol> wizard. This allows you to choose the type or the template for the
      file. If the action succeeds, the file is created with the referenced location and name and is
      opened in a new editor panel. This is useful when you decide first on the file name and after
      that you want to create it in the exact location specified at the current caret position.</p>
