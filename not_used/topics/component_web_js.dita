  <body>
    <p>Applets can communicate with JavaScript code that runs in the Web Page. JavaScript code can
      call an applet Java methods and from the Java code you can invoke JavaScript code from the web
      page.</p>
    <p>You are not limited to displaying only <i>Swing</i> dialog boxes from the applet. From the
      operations of an applet, you can invoke a JavaScript API that displays a web page and then
      obtains the data that has been filled in by the user.</p>
