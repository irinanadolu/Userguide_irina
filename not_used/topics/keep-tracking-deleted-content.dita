    <p>When <uicontrol>Track</uicontrol> changes is disabled and you delete selected content, the
      following is possible:<ul>
        <li>If the selection contains an entire <uicontrol>Delete</uicontrol> change, the change
          disappears and the content is deleted.</li>
        <li>If the selection intersects with a <uicontrol>Delete</uicontrol> change (starts or ends
          in one), it results in nothing happening.</li>
        <li>If the selection contains an entire <uicontrol>Insert</uicontrol> change, the change
          disappears and the content is deleted.</li>
        <li>If the selection intersects with an <uicontrol>Insert</uicontrol> change (starts or ends
          in one), the <uicontrol>Insert</uicontrol> change is shrunk and the content is deleted.
        </li>
      </ul>When <uicontrol>Track</uicontrol> changes is enabled and you delete selected content, the
      following is possible:<ul>
        <li>If the selection contains an entire <uicontrol>Delete</uicontrol> change, the change is
          considered as rejected and then marked as deleted by the current author, along with the
          other selected content.</li>
        <li>If the selection intersects a <uicontrol>Delete</uicontrol> change (starts or ends in

          along with the other selected content.</li>
        <li>If the selection contains an entire <uicontrol>Insert</uicontrol> change, the following
          is possible:<ul>
            <li>If the <uicontrol>Insert</uicontrol> is made by the same author, the change
              disappears and the content is deleted.</li>
            <li>If the <uicontrol>Insert</uicontrol> is made by another author, the change is
              considered as accepted and then marked as deleted by the current author, along with
              the other selected content.</li>
          </ul></li>
        <li>If the selection intersects an <uicontrol>Insert</uicontrol> change (starts or ends in

            <uicontrol>Insert</uicontrol> change that intersects with the selection is deleted.</li>
