      <p>The <b>Content Fusion Enterprise Virtual Machine</b> should have the following ports accessible:<ul>
          <li><b>80, 443</b> - For HTTP/HTTPS access to the main application.</li>
          <li><b>9080</b> - For access to the administration page (you may want to restrict access
            to only have this page available to certain computers).</li>
          <li><b>22</b> - For SSH access.</li>
        </ul></p>

      <title>Initial Oxygen Content Fusion Configuration</title>
      <p>To configure <ph keyref="product"/> on the initial start of the VM, use the following
        procedure:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Access the administration web interface of <ph keyref="product"/> at:
            <codeph>https://&lt;server-address>:9080</codeph>.<note>By default, <ph keyref="product"
            /> uses a self-signed certificate, so the browser will display a security warning.
            Continue (for example, if you are using Edge or Internet Explorer, click <b>Details</b>
            and then <b>Go on to the webpage</b>).</note></li>
        <li>Log in using the following credentials:<ul>
            <li><b>user</b> = <i>fusion</i></li>
            <li><b>password</b> = <i>oxygenxml</i></li>
          </ul></li>
        <li>Change the password.</li>
        <li>
          <p>In the <uicontrol>General</uicontrol> tab, configure the <uicontrol>Domain
              Name</uicontrol> of the server. To properly configure the server, you should associate
            a domain name for this server in your <term>DNS</term>.</p>
          <p>You can also use the server IP address instead of the domain name. In this case, the
            server will run with several limitations:<ul>
              <li>The e-mail messages generated by the server are more likely to be considered as
                SPAM.</li>
              <li>HTTPS support cannot be enabled.</li>
            </ul><note>By default, the <uicontrol>Domain Name</uicontrol> is populated with one of
              the IP addresses associated with the server. It is recommended that you check this IP
              address to make sure it can be accessed by your end-users.</note></p>
        </li>
        <li>In the <uicontrol>License</uicontrol> tab:<ul>
            <li>If you already have a license key, choose the <uicontrol>Already have a license
                key</uicontrol> option, paste your license key in the text field and click
                <uicontrol>Activate</uicontrol>.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, choose the <uicontrol>Request a trial license key</uicontrol> option and
              complete the request form.</li>
          </ul></li>
      </ol>

      <title>Configuring Oxygen XML Editor/Author to Connect to Your Enterprise Server</title>
      <p>All <b>Content Authors</b> in your organization that will be uploading tasks will need to
        configure <term>Oxygen XML Editor/Author</term> to connect to your Enterprise server. You
        need to provide them with your Enterprise server URL and then each of them will need to
        follow the procedure found in: <xref
          href="../../topics/connect-to-enterprise-server.dita#connect-to-enterprise-server"/>.
        Alternatively, if you want to impose the server URL for all <b>Content Authors</b> so that
        they do not need to do any manual configuration, you can <xref
          href="../../topics/cf-configure-server-address-property-file.dita">create a properties
          file to impose the Enterprise server address</xref>.</p>
