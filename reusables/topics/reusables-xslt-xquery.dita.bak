    <p id="breakpoint-conditions-p">Once you insert a <term>breakpoint</term>, it is automatically
      added to the list in the <uicontrol>Breakpoints</uicontrol> view and you can edit its
      associated <i>condition</i>. A <term>breakpoint</term> can have an associated break condition
      that represents an XPath expression evaluated in the current debugger context. For them to be
      processed, their evaluation result should be a boolean value. A <term>breakpoint</term> with
      an associated condition only stops the execution of the Debugger if the <term>breakpoint
        condition</term> is evaluated as <b>true</b>.</p>
