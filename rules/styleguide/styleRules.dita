  <title>Style Rules for the User Guide</title>
  <body>
    <p>Style rules are not concrete writing rules. Instead, they are style choices. There are no
      concrete right or wrong ways to choose style rules. However, it is important to be consistent
      with style choices to make documentation readable and appealing. You certainly do not want to
      irritate your audience by using multiple, inconsistent, and incompatible styles.</p>
    <p>To maintain consistent, readable, and visually appealing documentation, we will use a number 
      of <i>Style Rules</i> for the oXygen User Guide.</p>
