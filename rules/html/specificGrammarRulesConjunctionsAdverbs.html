          <dd class="dd"><strong class="ph b">Description:</strong><dfn class="term">Conjunctive adverbs</dfn> are simply adverbs that connect
            two independent clauses. They can sometimes move almost anywhere in a sentence and they
            are usually used to link the ideas from two or more sentences, but they can also be used
            to connect two independent main clauses in the same sentence (although this is probably
            rare in technical documentation). Usually, they are placed at the beginning of the
            second clause since it provides a logical transition from one clause to the other. When
            used to connect two main clauses a semicolon needs to be used between the first clause
            and the conjunctive adverb, but again, this is rare in technical documentation. Most of
            the time, the conjunctive adverbs need to be separated from the clause with one or two
            commas.</dd>

                <li class="li">Except in some very rare circumstances, only use <dfn class="term">conjunctive
                    adverbs</dfn> to connect the ideas from multiple sentences.</li>

                <li class="li">Most of the time, they should be used at the beginning of a sentence or as the
                  first words inside parentheses.</li>

                <li class="li">More often than not, they should be followed by a comma, and if used in the
                  middle of a sentence, they should also be preceded with a comma (the word
                    <em class="ph i">"thus"</em> is usually only preceded by a comma when used in the middle of a
                  sentence). <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> Keep in mind that some of these words can also be used as other
                    grammatical constructs (for example, <em class="ph i">"accordingly"</em> and <em class="ph i">"instead"</em>
                    are often used as regular adverbs in various parts of sentences without being
                    preceded or followed by a comma). However, when any of them are used as a
                      <dfn class="term">conjunctive adverb</dfn>, the above rules apply.<ul class="ul" id="specificGrammarRulesConjunctionsAdverbs__ul_cpy_kf3_kw">
                      <li class="li"><em class="ph i">"however"</em> - Somewhat of a special case since it can also be used as
                        a normal verb that means <em class="ph i">in whatever way</em> or <em class="ph i">to whatever degree</em>
                        (for example, <em class="ph i">"However you decide to do it, ..."</em>). Regardless,
                        whenever it is used as a <dfn class="term">conjunctive adverb</dfn>, follow the rules

                      <li class="li"><em class="ph i">"also"</em> - This is a rather flexible adverb and can be used in
                        multiple other ways (for example, as a <dfn class="term">focusing adverb</dfn>) without
                        needing punctuation before or after. Regardless, when used as a

          <dt class="dt dlterm">Position of Adverbs in a Sentence</dt>

          <dd class="dd"><strong class="ph b">Description:</strong> There are so many complex rules for where to position different
            types of adverbs within a sentence that it is not even worth discussing most of them.
            Essentially, an <dfn class="term">adverb</dfn> is a word that modifies another word or phrase. In
            most cases, you should make sure the adverb is placed as close to the word or phrase
            that it is modifying as possible and you should always pay attention to how the
            placement of the adverb can change the meaning of the sentence. For more specific rules
            in regards to the placement of adverbs, the following website defines some very clear
            rules for various situations: <a class="xref" href="http://www.englishpractice.com/improve/position-adverbs-2/" target="_blank">http://www.englishpractice.com/improve/position-adverbs-2/</a>.<div class="p">
              <dl class="dl">

                  <dd class="dd">For the purposes of our documentation, we should concentrate on making sure
                    certain <dfn class="term">focusing adverbs</dfn> are placed in the proper position because
                    they represent the most common errors and improper positioning of these adverbs
                    can lead to sentences that are awkward or where the meaning is unclear. Since
                    focusing adverbs point to a particular part of a sentence, the meaning conveyed
                    often depends upon their position. The adverbs <em class="ph i">"also"</em> and <em class="ph i">"only"</em>
                    are the most common examples that are used in our

                      adverbs in front of and next to the word or words they are modifying. However,
                      be aware that doing so will not always eliminate ambiguity. Therefore, you
                      have to also rely on the context and consider the meaning of the sentence
                      based upon the placement of the adverb. If you find it difficult to decide
                      where to place them, try rephrasing the sentence entirely.</p>
