          <dd class="dd">If you <em class="ph i">really</em> want to produce great documentation, it needs to be proofread and
            edited. No matter how talented a writer happens to be, it is nearly impossible to avoid
            mistakes on the first attempt.<div class="p"><strong class="ph b">Tips for proofreading and editing:</strong><ul class="ul" id="writingTips__ul_np2_hg3_kw">
                <li class="li">It is often a good idea to write all of your text, then take a break from it,
                  and return to proofread and edit it later with fresh eyes and ideas.</li>

                <li class="li">When proofreading your text, shorten, delete, and rewrite anything that does not
                  add to its meaning.</li>

                <li class="li">It is also a good idea to have someone else review your documentation because
                  when you read something you wrote yourself, you know what you <em class="ph i">meant</em> to
                  write, so it is really easy to just skip over typos or missing words.</li>

                <li class="li">If you are editing your own work, changing the indent structure or font size can
                  help you recognize mistakes that were previously unnoticed.</li>

                    sentences should always be complete. Proofread your work carefully to spot

                  <dd class="dd"><u class="ph u"><strong class="ph b">Rules or Suggestions:</strong></u> It is usually a good practice to avoid
                    redundancy, or extra unnecessary words, in your writing. Redundancy makes your
                    writing less effective because it makes the reader waste time and attention
                    re-reading information that was already provided. The point of your writing
                    should be to provide all the necessary information in the most precise and
                    effective manner possible. There are times when it is good to use redundancy for
                    emphasis, but in all other situations it is best to avoid it.</dd>

                          just use <em class="ph i">"since you last</em>. This also applies without the word
                            <em class="ph i">"last"</em>. For example, <em class="ph i">"since the time you opened the file"</em>
                          should be <em class="ph i">"since you last opened the file"</em>.</li>

                      technical writing is to make sure the information that you write is very
                      clear. Use the following rules to help avoid confusion:<ul class="ul" id="writingTips__ul_pp2_hg3_kw">
                        <li class="li">Always proofread your writing carefully to identify possible
                          ambiguity.</li>

                        <li class="li">It is also always a good idea to have someone else proofread your
                          writing because it may seem clear to you, but if it is ambiguous to them,
                          in any way, then it is probably also ambiguous to your normal
                          audience.</li>

                        <li class="li">Be careful when using pronouns (<em class="ph i">"this</em>, <em class="ph i">"these"</em>,
                            <em class="ph i">"it"</em>). Always ask yourself if there is any chance that the reader
                          will not know exactly what items the pronouns are referencing. See the

                  <dd class="dd"><u class="ph u"><strong class="ph b">Rules or Suggestions:</strong></u> Always consider who your audience might be

                  <dd class="dd"><u class="ph u"><strong class="ph b">Rules or Suggestions:</strong></u> The best writing is simple and concise,
                    with the relevant ideas delivered in a clear and direct manner. Avoid using

                  <dt class="dt dlterm">Avoid Passive Voice</dt>

                  <dd class="dd"><u class="ph u"><strong class="ph b">Rules or Suggestions:</strong></u> Particularly in technical writing, you
                    should avoid using a <dfn class="term">passive voice</dfn> whenever possible.
                      <dfn class="term">Passive</dfn> writing comes across as sounding weak and ambiguous,
                    while using in an active voice makes your writing seem more alive and clear.
                    Basically, passive voice happens when the object of a sentence is placed in the
                    beginning of a sentence instead of the end. In other words, the object becomes
                    the subject. For example, <em class="ph i">"I mailed the letter"</em> becomes passive if it is
                    changed to <em class="ph i">"The letter was mailed by me"</em>.<div class="p">

                          <dt class="dt dlterm">How to recognize a <em class="ph i">Passive Voice</em> sentence</dt>

                          <dd class="dd">The two most basic things to ask yourself are:<ul class="ul" id="writingTips__ul_qp2_hg3_kw">
                              <li class="li">Is the object in the subject position?</li>

                              <li class="li">Can I add <em class="ph i">"by [so-and-so]"</em> to the end?</li>

                            </ul>
</dd>

                          <dd class="dd ddexpand">Also, keep this in mind: All passive sentences include a form of the
                            verb <em class="ph i">"to be"</em> (such as <em class="ph i">"was"</em>, <em class="ph i">"were"</em> or
                            <em class="ph i">"is"</em>), BUT not all sentences that have those verbs are passive.
                            It is easy to recognize sentences that include a form of <em class="ph i">"to be"</em>
                            but you need to ask yourself the two questions above to determine if it
                            is in the passive voice.</dd>

                  <dd class="dd"><u class="ph u"><strong class="ph b">Rules or Suggestions:</strong></u> People read technical documentation
                    differently than they do other types of writing. They tend to skim through
                    documentation to quickly find the information they need. This means good
                    technical documentation needs to have a lot of structured markup to emphasize
                    content and point the reader directly to information they need for the specific

                    in the same topic, to create breaks in long blocks of text, and to introduce
                    procedures. The basic idea of using sections is to allow users to quickly find
                    the specific part of the topic that contains the information they are looking
                    for, without needing to read other content that may not be relevant to their
                    specific need. Each section should contain a good title that describes the
                    content of that section. This will also help readers find specific information
                    more quickly. </dd>

                    Likewise, paragraphs should also as short as possible because our brains take in
                    information better when it is broken into small chunks. Also, all the sentences

                        <li class="li">It is helpful to use titles for procedures, especially when the
                          procedure is surrounded by a large amount of content. This helps the
                          reader to quickly find the procedure that they are looking for amongst
                          blocks of other content.</li>

                        <li class="li">Only use <dfn class="term">unordered lists</dfn> (<code class="ph codeph">ul</code>) when steps
                          do not need to occur in sequence.</li>

                        <li class="li">Always use <dfn class="term">ordered lists</dfn> (<code class="ph codeph">ol</code>) when the
                          steps must occur in a sequence and make sure the items are in proper
                          order.</li>

                        <li class="li">Each step in a procedure should be an action in the sequence.</li>

                        <li class="li">If possible, eliminate steps that lack action. Instead, put
                          informational content after the action within a step, or put it outside
                          the step (for example, in a <code class="ph codeph">paragraph</code> or <code class="ph codeph">step
                            result</code>).</li>

                        <li class="li">Use sub-steps rather than putting too many tasks within one step.</li>

                        <li class="li">Clearly identify optional steps. For example, put the word
                            <em class="ph i">"optional"</em> in parentheses at the beginning of the step.</li>

                        <li class="li">Identify conditional steps with words such as <em class="ph i">"if"</em> and
                            <em class="ph i">"then"</em>.</li>

                        <li class="li">Use an additional list within a list for branching steps, such as
                          alternative methods.</li>

                        <li class="li">Edit and rewrite ambiguous steps. Proofread the entire procedure, or
                          better yet, have someone else read the procedure, and if there is any
                          ambiguity in any of the steps, the procedure needs to be revised. </li>
