          <dd class="dd"><strong class="ph b">Description:</strong> This is one of the most common errors made in English writing.
            There is a common misperception that the rule is that you use <em class="ph i">"a"</em> before words
            that start with a consonant and <em class="ph i">"an"</em> before words that start with a vowel.
            However, that is only partially correct. REMEMBER, it is how the subsequent word SOUNDS,
            not how it is written. The letters 'H' and 'U' usually cause the most confusion because
            some words that start with those letters have a consonant sound and some have a vowel
            sound.</dd>

          <dd class="dd"><strong class="ph b">Description:</strong> This is another one of the most common problems found in English
            writing. Many grammarians consider both to be acceptable, especially when speaking, but
            when using them in technical writing, you should not use them interchangeably because
            they have different implications. <em class="ph i">"Like"</em> suggests comparison (something is
            similar to something else), while <em class="ph i">"such as"</em> implies inclusion (something is
            precisely included as an example of something).</dd>

          <dd class="dd"><strong class="ph b">Description:</strong> There are some experts who believe this is more of a style choice
            than a grammar rule, but those people are completely ignoring the fact that when these
            two words are used interchangeably they are usually two completely different types of
            grammatical words (<em class="ph i">"that"</em> being an adjective in these instances, and
              <em class="ph i">"which"</em> being a pronoun/determiner). Some people might also argue that the
            rules are more complex and flexible than the rules we will use, but it is important to
            keep the rules simple and for the purposes of our User Guide, we use these two words in
            ways that are only grammatically correct and clear if we follow the rules listed below.
            Also, in most cases, it looks and sounds much better to use this common grammar
              rule.<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> It becomes even more complex and confusing when considering combination of
              words such as <em class="ph i">"for which"</em> or <em class="ph i">"in which"</em>. They are sometimes used instead
              of <em class="ph i">"that"</em> to prevent ending a sentence with a preposition. However, that
              becomes a completely different subject and this rule should not be used for those
              instances. The word <em class="ph i">"which"</em> is also used in multiple ways, some of which are
              not interchangeable with <em class="ph i">"that"</em> (for example, <em class="ph i">"determine which one to
                use"</em>). To make it as simple as possible, just use this rule to determine when to
              use the single words <em class="ph i">"that"</em> or <em class="ph i">"which"</em> when they could be used
              interchangeably. </div>

          <dd class="dd"><strong class="ph b">Description:</strong> Misusing the word <em class="ph i">"different"</em> is one of the most common
            problems in formal and technical writing. When speaking, or perhaps in colloquial
            writing, the two words are often used synonymously, but in formal or technical writing
            it is important to differentiate between the two. <em class="ph i">"Different"</em> implies a
            comparison (<em class="ph i">different</em> from what?), whereas <em class="ph i">"various"</em> or <em class="ph i">"multiple"</em>
            implies multiplicity or diversity.</dd>

              examples of words that might be better). Only use <em class="ph i">"different"</em> to refer to
              comparison or distinction between things. Also, if you are to use the word
                <em class="ph i">"different"</em>, stop and ask yourself "it is different from what?" If you cannot
              answer that question or it does not make sense, avoid using <em class="ph i">"different"</em>.</p>

          <dd class="dd"><strong class="ph b">Description:</strong> These three words are often misunderstood in English writing and
            many people incorrectly think they are completely synonymous. While their meanings are
            very similar, <em class="ph i">"however"</em> and <em class="ph i">"but"</em> introduces a contrast or contradiction
            to a previous statement, while <em class="ph i">"although"</em> does not necessarily imply contrast and
            can be used if both statements could be true. Also, <em class="ph i">"but"</em> and <em class="ph i">"although"</em>
            are conjunctions, while <em class="ph i">"however"</em> is an adverb and needs to be used differently
            in the sentence structure.</dd>

                <li class="li"><strong class="ph b"><em class="ph i">"However"</em></strong> - When using <em class="ph i">"however"</em>, in most cases it should

                  contrast or contradiction AND you want to start a new sentence (therefore

                  sentence and it needs to be preceded by a comma. Use it when you want to stress
                  contrast or contradiction AND you do not want to start a new sentence (therefore

                <li class="li"><strong class="ph b"><em class="ph i">"Although"</em></strong> - This word may be used to start a sentence or in the
                  middle of a sentence. When using it to start a new sentence it would not be
                  followed by a comma. When using it in the middle of a sentence it needs to be
                  preceded by a comma. Use it when you want to stress that both parts of the
                  statement may be true (make sure both parts of the statement are included in the
                  sentence).</li>

            modern writers have decided that it is too complicated and not worth their time to
            consider so they simply ignore all of them and never include <em class="ph i">"or not"</em> even when
            doing so leads to ambiguity. They justify this by suggesting that the <em class="ph i">"or not"</em> is
            implied when appropriate and is therefore optional. However, this is clearly not always
            the case. Your meaning can easily become unclear or ideas might seem incomplete if you
            omit <em class="ph i">"or not"</em> in many cases. In the very least, it might irritate your reader if
            they have to pause and re-read the sentence, and its surrounding sentences, to decipher
            the intended meaning.<div class="p">Consider the following example: <em class="ph i">Oxygen prompts you to choose
