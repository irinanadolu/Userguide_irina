            complicated when dealing with nouns that end in an <em class="ph i">"s"</em> (plural or singular)
            and it can sometimes lead to confusion. However, in technical writing, it is better
            to avoid using possession to avoid any possibility of confusion. In most instances,
            there is an alternate way of writing sentences that might include words that show
            possession. While these alternate ways might sometimes seem overly formal for
            general writing or spoken communication, in technical writing, not only are they
            acceptable, but they are actually preferred because the more formal ways of writing
            the sentences are usually considered to be more professional and more grammatically
            correct. </dd>

              writing the sentence and in those cases, use an apostrophe plus <em class="ph i">"s"</em> at the

            experts and there does not seem to be a consensus for how they should be written.
            The problem is that there are a variety of ways that acronyms are read and
