  <div class="abstract glossdef"><strong class="ph b"><dfn class="term">Named User</dfn></strong> is defined as an individual full or part-time employee
    who is authorized by <dfn class="term">You</dfn> (the individual or entity who owns the rights for <span class="ph">Oxygen XML Editor</span>) to use the software regardless of whether or not the individual is
    actively using the software at any given time. To avoid any doubt, <dfn class="term">Named User</dfn>
    licenses cannot be shared among multiple individuals and separate <dfn class="term">Named User</dfn>
    licenses must be purchased for each individual user.<div class="p">A <dfn class="term">Named User</dfn> license may not
      be reassigned to another employee except in the following circumstances:<ul class="ul">
        <li class="li">(a) Upon termination of the <dfn class="term">Named Userâ€™s</dfn> employment with your company.</li>
        <li class="li">(b) Permanent reassignment of a <dfn class="term">Named User</dfn> to a position that does not
          involve the use of the Software.</li>
      </ul></div>For example, suppose Jane has been assigned an <dfn class="term">Oxygen</dfn> license and she
    leaves your company. When she leaves, you can simply reassign her license to John, her
    replacement. In the event that you do reassign the <dfn class="term">Named User</dfn> license in accordance
    with the restrictions above, you do not need to notify Syncro of such a reassignment.<div class="note note note_note"><span class="note__title">Note:</span> This definition is taken from the <span class="ph">Oxygen XML Editor</span>
