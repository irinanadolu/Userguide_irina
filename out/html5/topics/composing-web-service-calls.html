    <p class="p"><span class="ph uicontrol">WSDL SOAP Analyzer</span> is a tool that helps you test if the messages
      defined in a Web Service Descriptor (WSDL) are accepted by a Web Services server. </p>
    <p class="p">After you edit and validate your Web service descriptor against a mix of the XML Schemas for
      WSDL and SOAP, it is easy to check if the defined SOAP messages are accepted by the remote Web
      Services server by using the integrated <span class="ph uicontrol">WSDL SOAP Analyzer</span> tool
      (available from the toolbar or <span class="ph uicontrol">Tools</span>
      menu).</p>
    <div class="p"><span class="ph">Oxygen XML Editor</span> provides two ways of testing, one for the currently edited WSDL
      document and another for the remote WSDL documents that are published on a web server. To open
      the <span class="ph uicontrol">WSDL SOAP Analyzer</span> tool for the currently edited WSDL document do
      one of the following:<ul class="ul">
        <li class="li">Click the <span class="ph uicontrol"><img class="image" id="composing-web-service-calls__image_mnh_zxh_5r" src="../img/WsdlShowDialog16.png">WSDL SOAP Analyzer</span> toolbar button.</li>

    <div class="p">This tool contains a SOAP analyzer and sender for Web Services Description Language file
      types. The analyzer fields are as follows:<ul class="ul">
        <li class="li"><span class="ph uicontrol">Services</span> - The list of services defined by the WSDL file.</li>
        <li class="li"><span class="ph uicontrol">Ports</span> - The ports for the selected service.</li>
        <li class="li"><span class="ph uicontrol">Operations</span> - The list of available operations for the selected
          service.</li>
        <li class="li"><span class="ph uicontrol">Action URL</span> - The script that serves the operation.</li>
        <li class="li"><span class="ph uicontrol">SOAP Action</span> - Identifies the action performed by the script.</li>
        <li class="li"><span class="ph uicontrol">Version</span> - Choose between 1.1 and 1.2. The SOAP version is
          selected automatically depending on the selected port.</li>
        <li class="li"><span class="ph uicontrol">Request Editor</span> - It allows you to compose the web service
          request. When an action is selected, <span class="ph">Oxygen XML Editor</span> tries to generate as much
          content as possible for the SOAP request. The envelope of the SOAP request has the correct
          namespace for the selected SOAP version, that is
            <em class="ph i">http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/</em> for SOAP 1.1 or
            <em class="ph i">http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope</em> for SOAP 1.2. Usually you just have to
          change a few values for the request to be valid. The <a class="xref" href="../glossary/content-completion-assistant.html"><dfn class="term">Content Completion
              Assistant</dfn></a> is available for this editor and is driven by the schema that
          defines the type of the current message. While selecting various operations, <span class="ph">Oxygen XML Editor</span> remembers the modified request for each one. You can click the
            <span class="ph uicontrol">Regenerate</span> button to overwrite your modifications for the current
          request with the initial generated content.</li>
        <li class="li"><span class="ph uicontrol">Attachments List</span> - You can define a list of file URLs to be
          attached to the request.</li>
        <li class="li"><span class="ph uicontrol">Response Area</span> - Initially it displays an auto generated server
          sample response so you can have an idea about how the response looks like. After pressing
          the <span class="ph uicontrol">Send</span> button, it presents the message received from the server
          in response to the Web Service request. It may show also error messages. If the response
          message contains attachments, <span class="ph">Oxygen XML Editor</span> prompts you to save them, then tries
          to open them with the associated system application.</li>
        <li class="li"><span class="ph uicontrol">Errors List</span> - There may be situations where the WSDL file is
          respecting the WSDL XML Schema, but it fails to be valid (for example, in the case of a
          message that is defined by means of an element that is not found in the types section of
          the WSDL). In such a case, the errors are listed here. This list is presented only when
          there are errors.</li>
        <li class="li"><span class="ph uicontrol">Send Button</span> - Executes the request. A status dialog box is
          displayed when <span class="ph">Oxygen XML Editor</span> is connecting to the server.</li>
      </ul></div>
    <div class="p">The testing of a WSDL file is straight-forward. Click the WSDL analysis button, then select
      the service, the port, and the operation. The editor generates the skeleton for the SOAP
      request. You can edit the request, eventually attach files to it and send it to the server.
      Watch the server response in the response area. You can find more details in the <a class="xref" href="testing-remote-wsdl-files.html#testing-remote-wsdl-files">Testing Remote WSDL
        Files</a> section.<div class="note note note_note"><span class="note__title">Note:</span> SOAP requests and responses are automatically validated in the
          <span class="ph uicontrol">WSDL SOAP Analyzer</span> using the XML Schemas specified in the WSDL
        file.</div></div>
    <p class="p">Once defined, a request derived from a Web Service descriptor can be saved with the
        <span class="ph uicontrol">Save</span> button to a Web Service SOAP Call (WSSC) file for later reuse.
      In this way, you save time in configuring the URLs and parameters.</p>
    <p class="p">You can open the result of a Web Service call in an editor panel using the
        <span class="ph uicontrol">Open</span> button.</p>
