        <li class="li">
          <p class="p">Are there any client requirements beyond the Java VM?</p>
          <p class="p">Oracle (formerly Sun) Java JRE version 1.8. At least 200 MB disk space and 200MB free
            memory is necessary for the <span class="ph">Oxygen XML Author Component</span>.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="li">
          <p class="p">Does the <span class="ph">Oxygen XML Author Component</span> support multiple documents being open
            simultaneously? What are the licensing ramifications?</p>
          <p class="p">A single <em class="ph i">AuthorComponentFactory</em> instance can create multiple
              <em class="ph i">EditorComponentProvider</em> editors that can then be added and managed by the
            developer who customizes the component in a Swing <em class="ph i">JTabbedPane</em>. A single license
            (floating or user-based) is enough for this.</p>
          <p class="p">If you need to run multiple distinct Java processes using the <span class="ph">Oxygen XML Author Component</span>, the current floating license model allows for only two
            concurrent components from the same computer when using the HTTP floating license
            server. An additional started component will take an extra license seat. </p>

    <section class="section" id="component_faq__functionality"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Functionality</h2>
      
      <ol class="ol">
        <li class="li">
          <p class="p">What graphic formats can be directly rendered in the <span class="ph">Oxygen XML Author Component</span>?</p>
          <p class="p">GIF, JPEG, PNG, BMP and SVG.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="li">
          <p class="p">Can links be embedded to retrieve (from the server) and "play" other types of
            digital assets, such as audio or video files?</p>
          <p class="p">You could add listeners to intercept clicks and open the clicked links. This would
            require a good knowledge of the <em class="ph i">Oxygen SDK</em>. The <span class="ph">Oxygen XML Author Component</span>
            can only render static images (no GIF animations). </p>
        </li>
        <li class="li">
          <p class="p">Does the <span class="ph">Oxygen XML Author Component</span> provide methods for uploading ancillary files
            (new graphics, for instance) to the hosting server?</p>
          <p class="p">No.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="li">
          <p class="p">Does the <span class="ph">Oxygen XML Author Component</span> provide any type of autosave functionality?</p>
          <p class="p">By default no, but you could customize it to save its content periodically to a file on
            disk.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="li">
          <p class="p">Assuming multiple documents can be edited simultaneously, can content be copied, cut,
            and pasted from one <span class="ph">Oxygen XML Author Component</span> "instance" to another?</p>
          <p class="p">Yes.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="li">
          <p class="p">Does the <span class="ph">Oxygen XML Author Component</span> support pasting content from external sources
            (such as a web page or a Microsoft Word document and, if so, to what extent?</p>
          <p class="p">If no customizations are available, the content is pasted as simple text.
            Customizations are provided for the major <dfn class="term">frameworks</dfn> (DITA, DocBook, TEI,
            etc.) that use a conversion XSLT stylesheet to convert HTML content from clipboard to
            the target XML.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="li">
          <p class="p">Can UTF-8 characters (such as Greeks, mathematical symbols, etc.) be inserted and
            rendered?</p>
          <p class="p">Any UTF-8 character can be inserted and rendered, provided that the font used for
            editing supports rendering the characters. The font can be changed by developers but not
            by the users. When using a logical font (by default, <em class="ph i">Serif</em> for the <span class="ph">Oxygen XML Author Component</span>), the JVM will know how to map all characters to glyphs.
            There is no character map available but you could implement one.</p>

      <ol class="ol">
        <li class="li">
          <p class="p">Describe, in general terms, the menus, toolbars, contextual menu options, helper panes,
            and so on, that are available for the <span class="ph">Oxygen XML Author Component</span> out-of-the box.</p>
          <p class="p">You can mount all actions available in the standalone <span class="ph">Oxygen XML Editor</span>
            application on your custom toolbar. This includes custom actions defined in the
              <dfn class="term">framework</dfn> customized for each XML type. </p>
          <p class="p">The <span class="ph">Oxygen XML Author Component</span> also can provide the <a class="xref" href="outliner-view.html#outliner-view"><span class="ph uicontrol">Outline</span></a>, <a class="xref" href="model-panel.html#model-panel"><span class="ph uicontrol">Model</span></a>, <a class="xref" href="author-elements-view.html#author-elements-view"><span class="ph uicontrol">Elements</span></a>, and <a class="xref" href="author-attributes-view.html#author-attributes-view"><span class="ph uicontrol">Attributes</span></a> views that can be added to your own
            panels.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="li">
          <p class="p">Describe, in general terms, the actions, project resources (for example, DTD/Schema for
            validation purposes, CSS/XSL for styling, etc.) and typical level of effort that would
            be required to deploy a <span class="ph">Oxygen XML Author Component</span> solution for a customer with a
            proprietary DTD.</p>
          <p class="p">The <span class="ph uicontrol">Author</span> mode internal engine uses CSS to render XML. </p>
          <p class="p">For a special type of XML, you can create a custom <dfn class="term">framework</dfn> (which also
            works in an <span class="ph">Oxygen XML Editor</span> standalone version) that would also contain default
            schemas and custom actions. A simple <dfn class="term">framework</dfn> would probably need 2-3
            weeks development time. For a complex <dfn class="term">framework</dfn> with many custom actions,
            it could take a long time. <span class="ph">Oxygen XML Editor</span> has built-in <dfn class="term">frameworks</dfn>
            for editing (DocBook, DITA, TEI, etc.) and sources for them are available in <a class="xref" href="https://www.oxygenxml.com/developer.html#XML_Editor_Authoring_SDK" target="_blank" rel="external noopener"> the Oxygen SDK</a>.</p>
          <p class="p">Multiple <dfn class="term">frameworks</dfn> can co-exist in the same <span class="ph">Oxygen XML Editor</span>
            instance and can be used at the same time for editing XML documents.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="li">
          <p class="p">Many customers desire a very simplistic interface for contributors (with little or no
            XML expertise) but a more robust XML editing environment for editors (or other users
            with more advanced XML expertise). How well does the <span class="ph">Oxygen XML Author Component</span>
            support varying degrees of user interface complexity and capability?</p>

                <p class="p">You assemble all the UI parts from the <span class="ph">Oxygen XML Author Component</span>. For
                  example, you could provide two implementations: one for advanced users and one for

                <p class="p">You could avoid placing the <dfn class="term">change tracking</dfn> toolbar actions in the
                  UI. You could also use the API to turn <dfn class="term">change tracking</dfn> ON when the

                <p class="p">Using our API, you can customize what the Outline view or Breadcrumb displays for
                  each XML tag. You can also customize the in-place content completion list.</p>

                <p class="p">The API allows for a content completion filter that also affects the
