    <p class="p">The <span class="ph uicontrol">Compare Directories Against a Base (3-way)</span> tool allows you to
      perform three-way comparisons on directories to help you identify and merge changes between
      multiple modifications of the same directory structure. It is especially helpful for teams
      that have multiple authors contributing documents to the same directory system. It offers
      information about conflicts and changes, and includes actions to easily merge, accept,
      overwrite, or ignore changes to the directory system.</p>
