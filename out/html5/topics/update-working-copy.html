    <div class="body">
        <p class="p">While you are working on a project, other members of your team may be committing changes
            to the project repository. To get these changes, you have to <em class="ph i">update</em> your working
            copy. Updating may be done on single files, a set of selected files, or recursively on
            entire directory hierarchies. The update operation can be performed from <a class="xref" href="working-copy-view.html"><span class="ph uicontrol">Working Copy</span> view</a>. It
            updates the selected resources to the last synchronized revision (if remote information
            is available) or to the <em class="ph i">HEAD</em> revision of the repository.</p>
        <p class="p">There are three different kinds of incoming changes:</p>
        <ul class="ul">
            <li class="li"><em class="ph i">Non-conflicting</em> - A non-conflicting change occurs when a file has been
                changed remotely but has not been modified locally.</li>
            <li class="li"><em class="ph i">Conflicting, but auto-mergeable</em> - An auto-mergeable conflicting change occurs
        when a text file has been changed both remotely and locally (for example, has non-committed
        local changes) but the changes are on different lines of text. Not applicable to binary
        resources (for example, multimedia files, PDFs, executable program files)</li>
            <li class="li"><em class="ph i">Conflicting</em> - A conflicting change occurs when one or more of the same lines
                of a text file have been changed both remotely and locally.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="p">If the resource contains only incoming changes or the outgoing changes do not intersect
            with incoming ones then the update will end normally and the Subversion system will
            merge incoming changes into the local file. In the case of a conflicting situation the
            update will have as result a file with conflict status.</p>
      <p class="p">The <span class="ph">Oxygen XML Editor</span> allows you to update your working copy files to a specific
      revision, not only the most recent one. This can be done by using the <span class="ph uicontrol">Update to
        revision/depth</span> action from the <span class="ph uicontrol">Working Copy</span> view
        (<span class="ph uicontrol">All Files</span> view mode) or the <span class="ph uicontrol">Update to
        revision</span> action from the <a class="xref" href="history-view.html"><span class="ph uicontrol">History</span> view</a> contextual menu.</p>
        <p class="p">If you select multiple files and folders and then you perform an
                <span class="ph uicontrol">Update</span> operation, all of those files and folders are updated
            one by one. The Subversion client makes sure that all files and folders belonging to the
            same repository are updated to the exact same revision, even if between those updates
            another commit occurred.</p>
        <p class="p">When the update fails with a message saying that there is already a local file with the
      same name Subversion tried to check out a newly versioned file, and found that an unversioned
      file with the same name already exists in your working folder. Subversion will never overwrite
      an unversioned file unless you specifically do this with an <span class="ph uicontrol">Override and
        update</span> action. If you get this error message, the solution is simply to rename
      the local unversioned file. After completing the update, you can check to see if the renamed
      file is still needed.</p>
