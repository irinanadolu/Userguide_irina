      <p class="p">This merge type is useful when you need to duplicate changes from one child branch (for
        example, <code class="ph codeph">CB1</code>) to another child branch (<code class="ph codeph">CB2</code>) from the same
        parent branch. The SVN client will calculate the changes necessary to get from the
          <code class="ph codeph">HEAD</code> revision of the parent branch (or the <em class="ph i">trunk</em>) to the
          <code class="ph codeph">HEAD</code> revision of one of its child branches (<code class="ph codeph">CB1</code>), and
        apply those changes to your working copy of the other branch (<code class="ph codeph">CB2</code>). The
        result is that the latter child branch (<code class="ph codeph">CB2</code>) will also include the changes
        made on the original child branch (<code class="ph codeph">CB1</code>), although that branch was not
        reintegrated into the parent branch.</p>
      <p class="p">This merge type could also be used to reintegrate a child branch back into its parent when
        the repository does not support <em class="ph i">merge tracking</em>.</p>
      <div class="note note note_note"><span class="note__title">Note:</span> If the server does not support <em class="ph i">merge-tracking</em>, then this is the only way to merge
        a branch back to its parent.</div>
