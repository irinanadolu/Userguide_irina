    <p class="p">The <span class="ph uicontrol"><img class="image" id="delete-resources-working-copy__image_uvd_tbp_5r" src="../img/SVNDelete16.gif">Delete</span>
      action is available in the contextual menu of the <a class="xref" href="working-copy-view.html"><span class="ph uicontrol">Working Copy</span> view</a>. When you delete an item from the working
      copy, it is marked as <em class="ph i">deleted</em> (scheduled for deletion from repository upon the next
      commit) and removed from the file system. Depending on the state of each item, you are
      prompted to confirm the operation.</p>
    <div class="p">If a resource is deleted from the file system without Subversion's knowledge, the resource is
      marked as <em class="ph i">missing</em> ( <img class="image" src="../img/SVNWCMissing10.png"> ) in your working
      copy. You can decide what you want to do with a <em class="ph i">missing</em> item:<ul class="ul">
        <li class="li">In the case of a commit, any <em class="ph i">missing</em> item is first automatically deleted
          and then committed.<div class="note note note_note"><span class="note__title">Note:</span> Not any <em class="ph i">missing</em> item can be committed as
              <em class="ph i">deleted</em>, and removed from the repository. For example, you cannot commit
            an item that no longer exists on the disk and that was scheduled for addition ( <img class="image" id="delete-resources-working-copy__image_nfh_4jp_5r" src="../img/SVNWCAdded10.png"> ) previously, since this item
            does not exist in the repository, but you can use the <span class="ph uicontrol">Delete</span>
            action instead.</div></li>
        <li class="li">If you want to recover <em class="ph i">missing</em> items, either <a class="xref" href="update-working-copy.html">update</a> the items themselves or one of their
          parent directories. This fetches their latest version from the repository.</li>
      </ul></div>
    <div class="p">You can also delete conflicting items (file content conflicts, property conflicts,
      tree-conflicts) and Syncro SVN Client automatically marks them as resolved.<div class="note note note_note"><span class="note__title">Note:</span> It is
        recommended that you resolve conflicts manually to avoid loosing any important remote
        modifications.</div></div>
    <p class="p">Finally, you can change your mind and <a class="xref" href="revert-changes.html">revert</a> the
      deleted items to their initial, pristine, state.</p>
