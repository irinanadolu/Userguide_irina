      </figure>
    </div>
    <p class="p">You can either create a new XML document from scratch by choosing one of the available types
      in the wizard. You can also create one from a template by choosing a template from the <span class="ph uicontrol">Global templates</span>
      or <span class="ph uicontrol">Framework templates</span> folders. If you are looking for a common
      document type, such as DITA or DocBook, you can find templates for these document types in the
        <span class="ph uicontrol">Framework templates</span> folder. If your company has created its own
      templates, you can also find them there.<span class="ph"> After you use
        this dialog box to create a few documents, those document types will appear in the
          <span class="ph uicontrol">Recently used</span> folder, which allows you to easily create other new
        documents of those types.</span></p>
    <p class="p">For some document types, you may find a lot of different templates. For example, there are
      numerous templates for DocBook documents, and DITA topic types and maps. Choose the template
      that best meets your needs.</p>
    <section class="section" id="getting-started-first-XML-document__writing_your_first_document"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Writing Your First Document</h2>
      
      <p class="p">Depending on the type of document you choose, the <span class="ph">Oxygen XML Editor</span> interface changes
        to support editing that document type. This may include new menus, toolbar buttons, and
        items in the contextual menus. </p>
      <p class="p">Also, depending on the type of document
        you choose, <span class="ph">Oxygen XML Editor</span> may open your document in <a class="xref" href="text-mode-editor.html#text-mode-editor"><span class="ph uicontrol">Text</span></a> or <a class="xref" href="author-editor.html#author-editor"><span class="ph uicontrol">Author</span></a> mode.
          <span class="ph uicontrol">Text</span> mode shows the raw XML source file, while
          <span class="ph uicontrol">Author</span> mode shows a graphical view of the document. </p>
      <p class="p">The availability of
          <span class="ph uicontrol">Author</span> mode for your document type depends on the type you choose
        and if there is a CSS stylesheet available to create the <span class="ph uicontrol">Author</span> mode.
          <span class="ph">Oxygen XML Editor</span> includes default <span class="ph uicontrol">Author</span> mode views for most
        of the document types it supports. If your company has created its own document types,
          <span class="ph uicontrol">Author</span> mode stylesheets may have also been created for that type.
        However, if you create a plain XML file, or one based on a schema that is not included in
        the <span class="ph">Oxygen XML Editor</span> built-in support, you need to edit it in
          <span class="ph uicontrol">Text</span> mode or <a class="xref" href="dg-css-support-in-author.html">create your
          own <span class="ph uicontrol">Author</span> mode CSS</a> for it. </p>
      <p class="p">You can switch back and forth between
          <span class="ph uicontrol">Author</span> mode and <span class="ph uicontrol">Text</span> mode at any time by
        clicking the buttons at the bottom left of the editor window. You do not lose any formatting
        when switching from <span class="ph uicontrol">Author</span> to <span class="ph uicontrol">Text</span> mode.
          <span class="ph uicontrol">Text</span> and <span class="ph uicontrol">Author</span> modes are just different
        views for the same XML document.</p>
      <p class="p">There is also a <a class="xref" href="grid-mode-editor.html#grid-mode-editor"><span class="ph uicontrol">Grid</span> mode</a> available that displays all content in an XML
        document as a structured grid of nested tables. This is useful for certain kinds of
        documents, particularly those that are structured like databases. You can also use it when
        you want to display XML content in a table-like manner (for example, if you need to <a class="xref" href="export-to-excel.html#export-to-excel">extract XML content to a
        spreadsheet</a>).</p>
      <p class="p">If you use
          <span class="ph uicontrol">Author</span> mode, you might find that it is similar to word processors
        that you are used to. Likewise, the <span class="ph uicontrol">Text</span> mode is similar to many
        other typical text editors. If you are new to XML, the biggest difference is that XML
        documents have a particular structure that you have to follow. <span class="ph">Oxygen XML Editor</span>
        assists you with a continuous validation of the XML markup.</p>

      <p class="p">Each XML document type has a particular structure that you have to follow as you write and
        edit the document. Some document types give you a lot of choices, while others give you very
        few. In either case, you need to make sure that your document follows the particular
        structure for the document type you are creating. This means:</p>
      <ul class="ul" id="getting-started-first-XML-document__ul_q4x_zr4_y4">
        <li class="li">At any given location in the document, there are only certain XML elements allowed. <span class="ph"><span class="ph">Oxygen XML Editor</span> helps you
            determine which elements are allowed. In <span class="ph uicontrol">Author</span> mode, when you
            press <span class="ph uicontrol"><span class="keyword shortcut">Enter</span></span>, <span class="ph">Oxygen XML Editor</span> assumes
            that you want to enter a new element and shows you a list of elements that can be
            created in this location. Keep typing until the element you want is highlighted and
            press <span class="ph uicontrol"><span class="keyword shortcut">Enter</span></span> to insert the element. </span>If
          you want to view the overall structure of a document and see what is allowed (and where),
          you can use the <a class="xref" href="model-panel.html#model-panel"><span class="ph uicontrol">Model</span>
            view</a> (<span class="ph menucascade"><span class="ph uicontrol">Window</span><abbr title="and then"> &gt; </abbr><span class="ph uicontrol">Show View</span><abbr title="and then"> &gt; </abbr><span class="ph uicontrol">Model</span></span>).</li>
        <li class="li">When you create certain elements, you may find that your text gets a jagged red
          underline and you get a warning that your content is invalid. This is usually because the
          element you have just created requires certain other elements inside of it. Your document
          will be invalid until you create those elements. <span class="ph">Oxygen XML Editor</span> helps you with
          this. If there is only one possible element that can go inside the element you just
          created, <span class="ph">Oxygen XML Editor</span> creates it for you. However, if there is more than one
          possibility, you have to create the appropriate elements yourself. In many cases, <span class="ph">Oxygen XML Editor</span> presents <a class="xref" href="xml-quick-fixes.html#xml-quick-fixes">XML
              <dfn class="term">Quick Fixes</dfn></a> that help you resolve errors by offering proposals to

      <p class="p">Validation is the process of making sure that an XML document abides by the rules of its
        schema. If <span class="ph">Oxygen XML Editor</span> knows how to find the schema, it validates the document
        for you as you type. <span class="ph">Oxygen XML Editor</span> finds the schema automatically for most of the

        schema</a>.</p>
      <p class="p">When <span class="ph">Oxygen XML Editor</span> validates as you type, there is a small bar at the right edge

        invalid, the indicator turns red and a red flag shows you where the errors are found. Click
        that flag to jump to the error. Remember that sometimes your document is invalid simply
        because the structure you are creating is not yet complete. </p>
      <p class="p">In addition to problems with the validity of the XML document itself, <span class="ph">Oxygen XML Editor</span> also reports warnings for a number of conditions, such as if your document contains a

        specified by the document. The location of these warnings is marked in yellow on the
        validation bar. If the document contains warnings, but no errors, the validity indicator
        turns yellow. </p>
