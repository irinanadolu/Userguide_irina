    <p class="p">A <em class="ph i">tree conflict</em> is a conflict at the directory tree structure level and occurs when
      the user runs an update action on a resource that has the following conditions:</p>
    <ul class="ul">
      <li class="li">It is locally modified and the same resource was deleted from the repository (or deleted
        as a result of being renamed or moved).</li>
      <li class="li">It was locally deleted (or deleted as a result of being renamed or moved) and the same
        resource is incoming as modified from the repository.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="p">The same conflict situation can occur after a merge or a switch action. The action ends with
      an error and the folder containing the file that is now in the tree conflict state is also
      marked with a conflict icon.</p>
    <p class="p">Such a conflict can be resolved in one of the following ways that are available when the
      user double clicks on the conflicting resource or when running the <span class="ph uicontrol">Edit
        conflict</span> action:</p>
