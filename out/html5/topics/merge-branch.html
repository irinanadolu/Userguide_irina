          reintegrate a branch:<ul class="ul" id="merge-branch__ul_ncf_wtq_skb">
            <li class="li">The server must support merge tracking.</li>
            <li class="li">The source branch (to be reintegrated) must be coherently synchronized with its
              parent branch. This means that all revisions between the branching point and the last
              revision merged from the parent branch to the child branch must be merged to the
              latter one (there must be no missing revisions in-between).</li>
            <li class="li">The working copy <strong class="ph b">must not</strong> contain the following:<ul class="ul" id="merge-branch__ul_tbg_4lg_34">
                <li class="li">Local modifications.</li>
                <li class="li">A mixture of revisions (all items must point to the same revision).</li>
                <li class="li">Sparse directories (all directories must be of <strong class="ph b">infinity</strong> depth).</li>
                <li class="li">Switched items.</li>
              </ul></li>
            <li class="li">The revision of the working copy must be greater than or equal to the last revision
              of the parent branch with which the child branch was synchronized.</li>
          </ul></div>
        <div class="note tip note_tip"><span class="note__title">Tip:</span> You can use <a class="xref" href="pre-merge-checks.html#pre-merge-checks">the

      <p class="p">This method is useful when you have a feature branch on which the development has concluded
        and it should be merged back into its parent branch. Since you have kept the feature branch
        synchronized with its parent, the latest versions of them will be absolutely identical
        except for your feature branch changes. These changes can be reintegrated into the parent
        branch by using a working copy of it and the <span class="ph uicontrol">Reintegrate a branch</span>
        option.</p>
      <div class="p">This method uses the <em class="ph i">merge-tracking</em> features of Apache
          Subversionâ„¢ to automatically calculate the correct revision ranges and to perform
        additional checks that will ensure that the branch to be reintegrated has been fully updated
        with its parent changes. This ensures that you do not accidentally undo work that others
        have committed to the parent branch since the last time you synchronized the child branch
        with it. After the merge, all branch development will be completely merged back into the
        parent branch, and the child branch will be redundant and can be deleted from the
          repository.<div class="note tip note_tip"><span class="note__title">Tip:</span> Before reintegrating the child branch it is recommended to
          synchronize it with its parent branch one more time, to help avoid any possible
          conflicts.</div></div>
