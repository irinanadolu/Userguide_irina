      <p class="p">It is recommended to perform a merge on the whole working copy (select its root directory
        when triggering the operation) to avoid <em class="ph i">sub-tree mergeinfo</em>. <em class="ph i">Sub-tree mergeinfo</em>
        is the <em class="ph i">mergeinfo</em> recorded to describe a <em class="ph i">sub-tree merge</em>. That is, a merge done
        directly to a child of a branch root that might be needed in certain situations. There is
        nothing special about <em class="ph i">sub-tree merges</em> or <em class="ph i">sub-tree mergeinfo</em> except that the
        complete record of merges to a branch may not be contained solely in the <em class="ph i">mergeinfo</em> on
        the branch root and you may have to look to any <em class="ph i">sub-tree mergeinfo</em> to get a full
        accounting. Fortunately, Subversion does this for you and rarely will you need to look for
        it.</p>

      <div class="p">Subversion supports merging from foreign repositories. While all merge source URLs must
        point to the same repository, the merge target (from the working copy) may come from a
        different repository than the source. However, copies made in the merge source will be
        transformed into plain additions in the merge target. Also, <em class="ph i">merge-tracking</em> is not
        supported for merges from foreign repositories.<div class="note note note_note"><span class="note__title">Note:</span> When performing merges from
