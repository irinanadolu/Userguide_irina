  <div class="body">
    <p class="p">You can copy resources from various locations of the working copy. You select them in the
        <a class="xref" href="working-copy-view.html"><span class="ph uicontrol">Working Copy</span> view</a> and then
      use <span class="ph uicontrol">Copy to</span> from the contextual menu. This is not a simple file system
      copy, but an Apache Subversionâ„¢ command. It will copy the resource and the
      copy will also have the original history. This is one of the important features of Subversion,
      as you can keep track of where the copied resources originated.</p>
    <div class="p">Based on the selected items, the <span class="ph uicontrol">Copy to</span> action is available only if
      it can be performed. Even if the operation would not normally be possible in SVN (due to some
      invalid local file states against copy), <span class="ph">Oxygen XML Editor</span> performs the copy operation as
      a simple file system operation. This means no SVN versioning meta-data is affected.<div class="note note note_note"><span class="note__title">Note:</span> 
        <ul class="ul">
          <li class="li">If you copy an item to a directory that is <a class="xref" href="working-copy-view.html#working-copy-view__wc_local_file_status">not under version
              control</a> (<em class="ph i">unversioned</em> or <em class="ph i">ignored</em>), the history of the item is not
            preserved. For example, when copying directories, all items inside them will also be
            copied without history.</li>
          <li class="li">If you copy a directory that contains <a class="xref" href="working-copy-view.html#working-copy-view__wc_external"><em class="ph i">external</em></a>
            items, these are not copied. This is specific for SVN 1.7 working copies only. To fetch
            the <em class="ph i">external</em> items, use the <span class="ph uicontrol">Update</span> operation on the copied
            directory.</li>
        </ul>
      </div></div>
    <div class="p">In the <span class="ph uicontrol">Copy to</span> dialog box, you can navigate through the working copy
      directories to choose a target directory, to copy inside it. If you try to copy a single
      resource you are also able to change that resource's name. For <em class="ph i">versioned</em> items, you can
      select <span class="ph uicontrol">Ignore resource history</span> to copy them without their history
      (similar to a simple file system copy).<div class="note note note_note"><span class="note__title">Note:</span> The <span class="ph uicontrol">Copy to</span> dialog box
        only presents all the local directories that are a valid destination against the copy
        operation, based on their local file status. Also, the <a class="xref" href="working-copy-settings.html#working-copy-settings">working copy settings</a> are
        taken into account.</div></div>
    <p class="p">In the <span class="ph uicontrol">Commit</span> dialog box, only the directory in question will appear
      without its children.</p>
