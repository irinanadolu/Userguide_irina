  <div class="body">
    <p class="p">Although Subversion does not support committing to multiple locations at once, <span class="ph">Syncro SVN Client</span> offers this functionality regarding <em class="ph i">external</em> items.</p>
    <div class="p">If items to be committed belong to different <em class="ph i">external</em> definitions than those found in
      the working copy, they are grouped under the corresponding item that indicates their
      repository origin. Each parent item is rendered bold and its corresponding repository location
      is presented when hovering it. Parent items are decorated with a small arrow ( <img class="image" id="multiple-locations-commit__image_ozc_gz5_5r" src="../img/SVNStatusBarShowExternals12.png"> ) if they are
        <em class="ph i">external</em> definitions. The working copy root directory is never decorated and is not
      presented if there are no <em class="ph i">external</em> items listed (all items belong to the main working
      copy). Each child item is presented relative to the parent item.<div class="note note note_note"><span class="note__title">Note:</span> When an
          <em class="ph i">external</em> directory has modifications of its own, it is presented both as a parent
        item and as an item that you can select and commit. This is always the case for
          <em class="ph i">external</em> files.</div></div>
    <div class="p">The sets of items belonging to <em class="ph i">external</em> definitions from the same repository are
      committed together, resulting a single revision. So, the number of revisions can be smaller
      than the number of <em class="ph i">externals</em>. External definitions are considered from the same
      repository if they have the same protocol, server address, port, and repository address within
      the server.<div class="note note note_note"><span class="note__title">Note:</span> <em class="ph i">External</em> files are always from the same repository as the parent
        directory that defines them, so they are always committed together with the changes from
        their parent directory.</div></div>
