    <p class="p">When you installed the <strong class="ph b">WebHelp with Feedback</strong> system the first time (assuming the <a class="xref" href="deploying-webhelp-feedback.html#deploying-webhelp-feedback__create-db-note"><span class="ph uicontrol">Create new database structure</span> option</a> was selected), you
      should have been prompted to create an administrator account (or a user named
        <em class="ph i">administrator</em> was created by default). As an administrator, you have access to manage
      comments posted in your feedback-enabled WebHelp system. You can also manage the user
      information (such as role, status, or notification options).</p>
    <div class="p">To manage comments and user information, follow these steps:<ol class="ol" id="managing-webhelp-feedback__ol_ahq_fvj_vs">

          navigation bar and on the right side there is a <span class="ph uicontrol">Log in</span> button.
          Click this button and log in with your administrator credentials. This gives you access to
