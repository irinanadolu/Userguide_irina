    <p class="p">You can add comments to any selected area of content within XML documents, with the exception

      associated to a selection without modifying or deleting the content.</p>
    <p class="p">By default, when you annotate your XML documents, the comments are displayed in the
        <strong class="ph b">Author</strong> mode as <a class="xref" href="../glossary/callout.html"><dfn class="term">callouts</dfn></a>
      (balloons) and they are rendered with a unique name and background for each user. If comments
      are not currently displayed in callouts, select the <a class="xref" href="callouts-preferences-page.html#callouts-preferences-page__comments"><span class="ph uicontrol">Comments</span> option</a> in the <a class="xref" href="callouts-preferences-page.html#callouts-preferences-page"><span class="ph uicontrol">Callouts</span> preferences page</a>.
