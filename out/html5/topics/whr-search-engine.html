  <div class="body">
    <p class="p">Search engine has two main components:</p>
    <div class="p">
      <dl class="dl">
        
          <dt class="dt dlterm">Search indexer</dt>
          <dd class="dd">
            <p class="p">It is also known as a <strong class="ph b">spider</strong>. This component is active when you publish your
              documentation to WebHelp and it is responsible for creating the <dfn class="term">search
                index</dfn>. This component traverses all HTML pages (for DITA topics) to gather
              information.</p>
          </dd>
        
        
          <dt class="dt dlterm">Search interface</dt>
          <dd class="dd">This component is an interface between the user and the <dfn class="term">search index</dfn>. It
            helps the user to search through the <dfn class="term">search index</dfn> and displays results in
            the search page.</dd>
        
      </dl>
    </div>
    <section class="section" id="whr-search-engine__search_field"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Search Field and Results Page</h2>
      
      <p class="p">When you enter search terms in the
          <span class="ph uicontrol">Search</span> field, the results are displayed in a results page. When you
        click on a result, the topic is opened in the main pane and the search results are
        highlighted. If you want to remove the colored highlights, click the <span class="ph uicontrol"><img class="image" src="../reusables/topics/../../img/ShowHighlight16.png">Toggle Highlights</span> button at the
        top-right side of the page. The <span class="ph uicontrol">Search</span> field also includes an
          <dfn class="term">autocomplete</dfn> feature.</p>
      <p class="p">Each result includes the topic title that can be clicked to open that page.
        Under the title, a breadcrumb is displayed that shows the path of the topic and you can
        click any of the topics in the breadcrumb to open that particular page.</p>
      <p class="p">If you enter multiple search terms (other than <dfn class="term">stop
        words</dfn>), for any result that the search engine found at least one term but not one or
        more of the other terms, the <span class="ph uicontrol">Missing</span> terms will be listed below each
        result. </p>
    </section>
    <section class="section" id="whr-search-engine__section_t2q_ncr_5cb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">5-Star Rating Mechanism and Sorting</h2>
      
      <div class="p">The <span class="ph uicontrol">Search</span> feature is also enhanced with
        a rating mechanism that computes scores for every result that matches the search criteria.
        These scores are then translated into a 5-star rating scheme and the stars are displayed to
        the right of each result. The search results are sorted depending on the following:<ul class="ul" id="whr-search-engine__ul_ely_wvx_cr">
          <li class="li">Search entries that satisfy the phrase search criterion are presented first.</li>
          <li class="li">The number of keywords found in a single page (the higher the number, the
            better).</li>
          <li class="li">The context (for example, a word found in a title, scores better than a word found in
            unformatted text). The search ranking order, sorted by relevance is as follows:<ul class="ul" id="whr-search-engine__ul_swf_qzg_dr">
              <li class="li">The search term is included in a meta keyword.</li>
              <li class="li">The search term is in the title of the page.</li>
              <li class="li">The search term is in bold text in a paragraph.</li>
              <li class="li">The search term is in normal text in a paragraph.</li>
            </ul></li>
        </ul></div>
    </section>
    <section class="section" id="whr-search-engine__section_s5c_qcr_5cb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Tag Element Scoring Values</h2>
      
      <p class="p" id="whr-search-engine__webhelp_scoring">HTML tag elements are also assigned a scoring value and these values
        are evaluated for the search results. For information about editing these values, see <a class="xref" href="scoring-properties-search-results.html#scoring-properties-search-results">How to Change Element Scoring in Search Results</a>.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="section" id="whr-search-engine__search_rules"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Search Rules</h2>
      
      <div class="p">Rules that are applied during a search include:<ul class="ul" id="whr-search-engine__ul_zmy_wvx_cr">
          <li class="li">You can use quotes to perform an exact search for multiple word phrases (for example,
              <em class="ph i">"grow flowers"</em> will only return results if both words are found consecutively
            and exactly as they are typed in the search field). This type of search is known as a
              <dfn class="term">phrase search</dfn>.</li>
          <li class="li"><dfn class="term">Boolean Search</dfn> is supported using the following operators: <em class="ph i">and</em>,
              <em class="ph i">or</em>, <em class="ph i">not</em>. When there are two adjacent search terms without an operator,
              <em class="ph i">or</em> is used as the default search operator (for example, <em class="ph i">grow flowers</em> is
            the same as <em class="ph i">grow or flowers</em>).</li>
          <li class="li">The space character separates keywords (an expression such as <em class="ph i">grow flowers</em>
            counts as two separate keywords.</li>
          <li class="li">Words composed by merging two or more words with colon (":"), minus ("-"), underline
            ("_"), or dot (".") characters count as a single word.</li>
          <li class="li">Your search terms should contain two or more characters (note that stop words will be
            ignored). This rule does not apply to CJK (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) languages.</li>
          <li class="li">When searching for multi-word phrases in CJK (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) languages
            that often have multiple words appear in strings without a space separator, you need to
            add a space to separate the words. Otherwise, WebHelp will not find results. For
            example, Chinese uses a specialized character for space separators, but the current
            WebHelp implementation cannot detect such specialized characters, so to search for
              <strong class="ph b">开始之前</strong> (it translates as "before you begin" or "before start"), you have to enter
              <strong class="ph b">开始 之前</strong> (notice the space between the second and third symbols) in the search
            field.</li>
        </ul></div>
      <div class="note tip note_tip"><span class="note__title">Tip:</span> The <code class="keyword markupname xmlelement">&lt;indexterm&gt;</code> and <code class="keyword markupname xmlelement">&lt;keywords&gt;</code>
        DITA elements are an effective way to increase the ranking of a page (for example, content
        inside a <em class="ph i">keywords</em> element weighs more than an <em class="ph i">H1</em> HTML element).</div>
    </section>
    <section class="section" id="whr-search-engine__section_kn3_rcr_5cb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Excluded Terms</h2>
      
      <p class="p">To improve performance, the <span class="ph uicontrol">Search</span> feature
        excludes certain <dfn class="term">stop words</dfn>. For example, the English version of the <dfn class="term">stop
          words</dfn> includes: <em class="ph i">a, an, and, are, as, at, be, but, by, for, if, in, into, is, it,
          no, not, of, on, or, such, that, the, their, then, there, these, they, this, to, was,
          will, with</em>.</p>
