    <p class="p">Form controls make it easier to capture, organize, and edit content. They are especially
      helpful for less technical users because form controls provide a way to interact with the
      content of a document in a graphical manner without intimidating the user with the XML
      structure.</p>

        (<em class="ph i">Homepage</em>), and the <span class="ph uicontrol">[ + ]</span> and <span class="ph uicontrol">[ - ]</span>
      icons also represent button form controls that are assigned specific actions to add or delete

    <p class="p">You can use your imagination to envision the multitude of ways that you can use form controls
      to make the editing experience for content authors easier and more efficient. As a working
      example, a bundled <em class="ph i">samples</em> project (located in the <span class="ph filepath">samples</span> folder
      inside the <span class="ph">Oxygen XML Editor</span> installation directory) contains a file called
        <span class="ph filepath">personal.xml</span> that contains form controls. You can use this file, along
      with its corresponding <span class="ph filepath">personal.css</span> file to experiment with an example of
      how form controls can be implemented in <span class="ph uicontrol">Author</span> mode. </p>
