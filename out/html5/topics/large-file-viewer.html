  <div class="body">
    <p class="p">XML files tend to become larger and larger mostly because they are frequently used as a
      format for database export or for porting between multiple database formats. Traditional XML
      text editors simply cannot handle opening these huge export files, some having sizes exceeding
      one gigabyte, because all of the file content must be loaded in memory before the user can
      actually view it.</p>
    <p class="p">The best performance of the viewer is obtained for encodings that use a fixed number of bytes
      per character (such as UTF-16 or ASCII). The performance for UTF-8 is very good for documents
      that use mostly characters of the European languages. For the same encoding, the rendering
      performance is higher for files consisting of long lines (up to few thousands characters) and
      may degrade for short lines. In fact, the maximum size of a file that can be rendered in the
      Large File Viewer decreases when the total number of the text lines of the file increases.
      Trying to open a very large file (for example, a file of 4 GB) with a very high number of
      short lines (100 or 200 characters per line) may produce an <em class="ph i">out of memory</em> error
        (<span class="ph uicontrol">OutOfMemoryError</span>) that would require either increasing the Java heap
      memory with the <strong class="ph b">-Xmx</strong> startup parameter or decreasing the total number of lines in the
      file.</p>
    <p class="p">The powerful <span class="ph uicontrol">Large File Viewer</span> is available from the
        <span class="ph uicontrol">Tools</span> menu or as a standalone application. You can also right-click a
      file in your project and choose to open it with the viewer. It uses an efficient structure for
      indexing the open document. No information from the file is stored in the main memory, just
      a list of indexes in the file. In this way the viewer can open very large files, up to 10
      gigabytes. If the open file is XML, the encoding used to display the text is detected from
      the XML prolog of the file. For other file types, the encoding is taken from the <span class="ph">Oxygen XML Editor</span> options. See <a class="xref" href="preferences-encoding.html">Encoding for non-XML
        files</a>.</p>
