      Such customizations can be achieved through a plugin or a framework configuration. This

      customizations and to offer links to various resources to help with customizations.</p>

        <p>A <b>plugin </b> can be used to customize the behavior of the entire application no
          matter what XML document is currently being edited. Once created, a plugin can be <xref

            an add-on</xref>. For more information, see the <xref

        <p>A <b>framework </b> configuration provides validation, content completion, and editing
          support for a specific XML vocabulary. See: <xref format="html"
            href="https://blog.oxygenxml.com/topics/oxygenFrameworks.html" scope="external"/>. Once
          created, a framework can be deployed and installed as an add-on. See: <xref format="html"
            href="https://www.oxygenxml.com/doc/ug-editor/topics/packing-and-deploying-addons.html"

    <p>From a legal point of view, you can freely develop and share such extensions as long as they
      are only used from inside <ph keyref="product"/>. For details, see: <xref
