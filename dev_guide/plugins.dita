        <p>A <b>plugin </b>can be used to customize the behavior of the entire application no matter
      what XML document is currently being edited. Since <ph keyref="product"/> is a Java-based
      application, most of the allowed plugin types are Java-based but some JavaScript-based plugin
      types are also supported. </p>
        <p>There are lots of <xref href="../topics/pluginTypes.dita">plugin types</xref> but the
        <xref href="../topics/workspace-access-plugin.dita"><i>Workspace Access</i> plugin
        type</xref> is the most versatile of them. This type of plugin allows you to contribute
      actions to the main menu and toolbars, create custom views, interact with the application
      workspace, make modifications to open documents, and add listeners for various events. A
        <i>Workspace Access</i> plugin can also <xref
        href="../topics/additional-framework-extension.dita">contribute frameworks</xref>.</p>
        <p>The Maven-based <xref href="https://www.oxygenxml.com/oxygen_sdk.html" format="html"
        scope="external">Oxygen XML SDK</xref> comes with sample plugins and it provides the ability
      to compile Java extensions for your plugins and frameworks. Also, as a quick start for a
        <i>Workspace Access</i> plugin, you can use this project: <xref
        href="https://github.com/oxygenxml/sample-plugin-workspace-access" format="html"
        scope="external"/>. </p>
        <p>The <i>Workspace Access</i> plugin API can also be used with a <xref
        href="../topics/workspace-access-plugin-js.dita">JavaScript-based plugin</xref>. Small
      plugin samples can be found here: <xref
        href="https://github.com/oxygenxml/wsaccess-javascript-sample-plugins" format="html"
        scope="external"/>.</p>
        <p>You can <xref href="../topics/automated-tests.dita">create automated tests</xref> for
      your plugins and <xref href="../topics/debug-plugin.dita">debug them using the Eclipse
        IDE</xref>.</p>
        <p>A plugin can either be installed manually or packed as an add-on and <xref
        href="../topics/howto-install-plugins.dita">installed using <b>Help->Install new
        add-ons</b></xref>.</p>
