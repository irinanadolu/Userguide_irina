    <title>Adding Custom Transformation Scenarios</title>
    <body>
        <p>When distributing a framework to users, it is a good idea to have the transformation
      scenarios already configured. This helps the content authors publish their work in various
      formats. By being contained in the framework configuration, the scenarios can be distributed
      along with the actions, menus, toolbars, and catalogs. See: <xref
