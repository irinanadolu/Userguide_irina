    <title>Workspace Access Plugin</title>
    <body>
        <p>This type of <i keyref="glossentry_plugin">plugin</i> extension allows you to contribute
      actions to the main menu and toolbars, create custom views, interact with the application
      workspace, make modifications to open documents, and add listeners for various events. It is
      the most useful and most commonly used plugin extension.</p>
        <p>A <xref href="../topics/workspace-access-plugin.dita"><i>Workspace Access</i>
        plugin</xref> can also provide frameworks, allowing you to have a single add-on that
      provides both workspace-level extensions (independent of any given framework) and document
      type-specific frameworks. If the frameworks involve Java extensions (for example, custom
      dialog boxes or link text resolvers), they use the Java code for the <i>Workspace Access</i>
      plugin.</p>
        <p>You can include frameworks with a <i>Workspace Access</i> plugin by declaring an <xref
        href="../topics/additional-framework-extension.dita">"additional frameworks" extension in
        the <b>plugin.xml</b> file</xref>.</p>
