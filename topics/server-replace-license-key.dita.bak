    <p>The following procedure assumes that your <ph keyref="product"/> TCP floating license server
      contains a previously <xref
        href="../topics/floating-license-servlet-setup.dita#floating-license-servlet-setup/activate-li"
        >activated license key</xref> and provides instructions for replacing the activated license
      key with another one. The goal of the procedure is to minimize the license server downtime
      during the activation step of the new license key.</p>
    <p>This is useful if, for instance, you want to upgrade your existing license to the latest
      version or if you receive a new license key <xref
        href="installation-setting-up-license-server.dita#installation-setting-up-license-server/split_combine_floating"
        >that accommodates a different number of users</xref>.</p>
    <p>To replace a floating license key that is activated on your floating license server with a
      new one, follow these steps:<ol id="ol_rcd_xdk_vs">
        <li>Stop the service that runs the floating license server.</li>
        <li>Locate the folder that holds the previous activated license key (by default, it is named
            <filepath>license</filepath> and it is located in the installation directory of the
          license server).</li>
        <li>Remove the <filepath>license.txt</filepath> file and try to restart the server. Since
          the file that stores the license key is missing, <xref
            href="windows-service-reports-error-1067.dita#windows-service-reports-error-1067">the
            server will fail to start</xref>.</li>
        <li>Find the license activation procedure in the on-screen instructions (if the license
          server is started in a <b>command-line interface</b>) or in the
            <filepath>outLicenseServer.log</filepath> log file.</li>
        <li>After you copy the activated license key in the <filepath>license.txt</filepath> file,
          restart the license server.</li>
      </ol></p>
