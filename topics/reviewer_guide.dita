    <p>The <b>Reviewer</b> refers to subject matter experts or other team members who are asked to
      review documentation that has been uploaded to the <ph keyref="product"/> server by the
        <b>Content Author</b>. The <b>Reviewer</b> simply uses a link that is sent to them to access
      the task that contains the documents to be reviewed in their default browser. They can open
      each file to proofread, add comments, and make changes in a simple visual editor. They can
      share the task with other <b>Reviewers</b> and all of them can communicate with each other and
      the <b>Content Author</b> directly in the interface. Once the <b>Reviewer</b> finishes the
      review process, the <b>Content Author</b> will have the ability to merge all of the
      changes.</p>
    <p><b>Reviewers</b> also have the ability to create a new task in the <ph keyref="product"/>
      browser interface and create new files to attach to the created task.</p>
    <p>This guide provides instructions and information about the features and options the
        <b>Reviewers</b> have access to.</p>
