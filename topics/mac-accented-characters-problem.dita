      <title>Problem</title>
      <p>Mac OS X has a method for inserting accented characters that is triggered by holding a key
        and then selecting the desired character from a contextual menu. When using this method in
        OS X 10.14 (Mojave) to insert accented characters in <ph keyref="product"/>, the keyboard
        can no longer be used unless I restart the application.</p>
