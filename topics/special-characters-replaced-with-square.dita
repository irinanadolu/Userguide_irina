  <title>Special Characters are Replaced with a Square</title>

      <title>Problem</title>
      <p>My file was created with another application and it contains special characters (such as é,
        ©, ®, etc.) but <ph keyref="product"/> displays a square for these characters.</p>

      <title>Solution</title>
        <steps-informal>
          <p>You must set a font that is able to render the special characters in the <xref
              href="preferences-fonts.dita"><uicontrol>Font</uicontrol> preferences</xref>. If it is
            a text file, you must also set <xref href="preferences-encoding.dita">the encoding used
              for non XML files</xref>. If you want to set a font that is installed on your computer
            but that font is not accessible in the <uicontrol>Font</uicontrol> preferences, this
            means the Java virtual machine is not able to load the system fonts (probably because it
            is not a True Type font). It is a problem of the Java virtual machine and a possible
            solution is to copy the font file in the <filepath>[JVM_DIR]/lib/fonts</filepath>
            folder. <filepath>[JVM_DIR]</filepath> is the value of the property <i>java.home</i>
            that is available in the <uicontrol>System properties</uicontrol> tab of the
              <uicontrol>About</uicontrol> dialog box that is opened from menu <menucascade>
              <uicontrol>Help</uicontrol>
              <uicontrol>About</uicontrol>
            </menucascade>.</p>
