  <title>Numbering - Built-in CSS</title>
  <body>
    <p>The built-in CSS rules are in: </p>
		<ul id="ul_dfl_qj3_rhb">
			<li><filepath>[PLUGIN_DIR]/css/print/p-numbering-shallow.css</filepath></li>
			<li><filepath>[PLUGIN_DIR]/css/print/p-numbering-deep.css</filepath></li>
			<li><filepath>[PLUGIN_DIR]/css/print/p-numbering-deep-chapter-scope.css</filepath></li>
      <li><filepath>[PLUGIN_DIR]/css/print/p-numbering-deep-chapter-scope-no-page-reset.css</filepath></li>
		</ul>
		<p>The first CSS (shallow) contains rules that add a "Chapter NN" before the first-level topics
      from the publication, the second one (deep) contains rules that add a deep structure of
      counters on all topics referenced from the map (at any level), the third one (chapter-scope)
      creates a chapter scope-oriented numbering (meaning that the numbering for pages, tables,
      figures, and links to them are reset for each chapter), and the last one is similar to the
      third except that page numbers do not reset. For more details, see <xref
        href="dcpp_numbering_types.dita"/>.</p>
