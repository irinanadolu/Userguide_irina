      <title>Problem</title>
      <p>I receive an error indicating that <i>the current license was already activated on a
          License Server</i> or that the <i>License Server's Machine Signature does not
        match</i>.</p>
      <p>During the license activation process, the license key becomes bound to a particular
        license server deployment. This means that a code that uniquely identifies your license
        server deployment (called <term>Machine Signature</term>) is sent to the <ph
          keyref="product"/> servers, which in turn will sign the license key. The <term>Machine
          Signature</term> is computed from the list of network interfaces of the machine where you
        deployed the license.</p>
      <p>When starting the license server, if you receive an error stating that your server's
        Machine Signature does not match, there are several possible causes:</p>

        <title>Possible Cause 2</title>
        <p>A new network interface was changed, added, or activated in the machine that hosts your
          license server.<note>A specific example of when this could happen is if the Bluetooth or
            the WiFi module is activated/deactivated.</note></p>

        <title>Possible Cause 3</title>
        <p>The license server was restarted from a different location as the previous restart. For
          example, some server configurations will have the Apache Tomcat server installed in a
          versioned folder (<filepath>/usr/local/apache-tomcat-V.V.V</filepath>) with a symbolic
          link to the typical folder (<filepath>/usr/local/tomcat</filepath>). The server can be
          restarted from either location, but it is recommended to always restart from the typical
          folder (<filepath>/usr/local/tomcat</filepath>) and always restart from the same
          location.</p>

        <title>Solution</title>
        <steps-informal>
          <p>The server simply needs to always be restarted from the same location.</p>
