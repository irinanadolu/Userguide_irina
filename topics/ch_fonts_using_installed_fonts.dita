  <title>Using Installed Fonts</title>
  <body>
    <p>Suppose you want to style certain elements using a font that is available on your system. On
      Windows, it means it was installed in the <filepath>Windows/Fonts</filepath> directory. In
      this case, you can reference it directly like
      this:<codeblock outputclass="language-css">section h2 {
    font-family: Calibri;
}</codeblock>
    </p>
  </body>
