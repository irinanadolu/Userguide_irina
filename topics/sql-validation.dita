  <title>SQL Validation</title>
  <body>
    <p>SQL validation support is offered for IBM DB2. Note that if you choose a connection that does
      not support SQL validation, you will receive a warning when trying to validate. The SQL
      document is validated using the connection from the associated transformation scenario.</p>
