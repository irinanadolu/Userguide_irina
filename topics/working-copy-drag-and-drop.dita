  <title>Drag and Drop Operations</title>
  <body>
    <p>The structure of the files tree can be changed with drag and drop operations inside the
        <uicontrol>Working Copy</uicontrol> view. These operations behave in the same way with the
        <uicontrol>Copy to</uicontrol>/<uicontrol>Move to</uicontrol> operations.</p>
    <p>Also, files and folders can be added to the file tree of the view as <i>unversioned</i>
      resources by drag and drop operations from other applications (for example, from Windows
      Explorer or Mac OS X Finder). In this case, the items from the file system are only copied,
      without removing them from their original location.</p>
    <note type="attention">When you drag items from the working copy to a different application, the
      performed operation is controlled by that application. This means that the moved items are
      left as <i>missing</i> in the working copy (items are moved in the file system only, but
      no SVN versioning meta-data is changed).</note>
