  <title>Authentication Certificates Not Saved</title>
  <body>
    <p>If <ph keyref="svnProduct"/> prompts you to enter the authentication certificate, although
      you already provided it in a previous session, then you should make sure that your local
      machine user account has the necessary rights to store certificate files in the
        <i>Subversion</i> configuration folder (write access to <i>Subversion</i> folder
      and all its subfolders). Usually, it is located in the following locations:<ul>
        <li>Windows: <filepath>[HOME_DIR]\AppData\Roaming\Subversion</filepath></li>
        <li>Mac OS X and Linux: <filepath>[HOME_DIR]/.subversion</filepath></li>
      </ul></p>
