      <p>Once the Java access bridge is enabled and as long as the NVDA narrator is started, when

          <uicontrol>Elements</uicontrol> views) that help with editing the XML content. NVDA
        versions <b>2020.1</b> and older have a <xref
          href="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/5989" format="html" scope="external"
          >registered bug</xref> that makes the narrator read content from the side views when
        editing in the main editing area. Because of this problem, when using NVDA versions
          <b>2020.1</b> or older, the following workflow is suggested:<ol id="ul_qd1_r14_j3b">
          <li>Start <ph keyref="product"/>.</li>
          <li>Go to the <uicontrol>Window</uicontrol> menu and select <uicontrol>Maximize Editing
              Area</uicontrol> (or <uicontrol><shortcut>hold Alt, then W, then
              M</shortcut></uicontrol>). This action will hide all side views and allow you to
            properly edit in the main editing area.</li>
          <li>Whenever you want to open a side view, go to <menucascade>
              <uicontrol>Window</uicontrol>
              <uicontrol>Show View</uicontrol>
            </menucascade> (or <uicontrol><shortcut>hold Alt, then W, then S</shortcut></uicontrol>)
            and choose the view you want to open. For example, to show the
              <uicontrol>Elements</uicontrol> view, you can <uicontrol><shortcut>hold Alt, then W,
                then S, then E</shortcut></uicontrol>.</li>
          <li>When you are done using the side view, go to the <uicontrol>Window</uicontrol> menu
            and select <uicontrol>Hide current view</uicontrol> (or <uicontrol><shortcut>hold Alt,
                then W, then H</shortcut></uicontrol>) to hide the side view and return the focus to
            the main editing area.</li>

      <title>Hints for the Visually Impaired</title>
      <p>Here are a few hints for using <ph keyref="product"/> if you are visually impaired:<ul
          id="ul_owd_cv5_xcb">
          <li>The top main menu contains actions to open, save, and close documents, switch between
            open documents, or switch between the various editing modes for XML documents that are
            already open. All actions in the main menu bar should have mnemonics making it possible
            to memorize various shortcuts. For example, using the <uicontrol>alt-w-s-e</uicontrol>
            shortcut should open the <uicontrol>Window</uicontrol> menu, open the <uicontrol>Show
              view</uicontrol> submenu from it and show the <uicontrol>Elements</uicontrol> view,<ul
              id="ul_hyq_hv5_xcb">
              <li>The <uicontrol>File</uicontrol> menu contains actions to open, save, or close the
                currently edited XML document.</li>
              <li>The <uicontrol>Edit</uicontrol> menu contains actions to undo/redo or
                cut/copy/paste content. They also have the usual shortcuts that can be used instead
                of directly invoking the actions from the menu.</li>
              <li>The <uicontrol>Find</uicontrol> menu contains an action to show the
                  <uicontrol>Find/Replace</uicontrol> dialog box. Sometimes the <b>JAWS</b> narrator
                overloads the <uicontrol><shortcut>CTRL+F</shortcut></uicontrol> shortcut and
                presents its own find/replace window but the <ph keyref="product"/>
                <uicontrol>Find/Replace</uicontrol> dialog box provides the ability to perform
                complex find/replace operations in the open file.</li>
              <li>In the <uicontrol>Options</uicontrol> menu, you have access to the
                  <uicontrol>Preferences</uicontrol> dialog box that contains global application
                settings and access to the <b>Menu Shortcut Keys</b> table where you can configure
                shortcuts for the most commonly used actions.</li>
              <li>The <uicontrol>Window</uicontrol> menu includes actions to switch between open XML
                documents. Also, you can use the <uicontrol>Show view</uicontrol> submenu to open a
                particular side view and move the focus to that view.</li>
            </ul></li>
          <li>An open XML document can be edited with accessibility support either in the
              <uicontrol>Text</uicontrol> editing mode (where the XML tags are accessible in the
            edited content) or in the visual <uicontrol>Author</uicontrol> editing mode (where the
            XML tags are hidden and only the text content is shown). You can switch between these
            editing modes by using the <menucascade>
              <uicontrol>Document</uicontrol>
              <uicontrol>Edit Mode</uicontrol>
            </menucascade> menu.<ul id="ul_jgk_nk1_ycb">
              <li>
                <p><uicontrol>Text</uicontrol> mode provides access to the entire source document
                  with all of its <b>XML</b> content, just like you have in any text editing
                  application. </p>
                <p>Pressing the <uicontrol><shortcut>&lt;</shortcut></uicontrol> key will present a
                  list of <xref keyref="glossentry_content-completion-assistant">available XML
                    elements</xref>. If you do not want to choose from the list whenever you want to
                  insert an XML element, you have two choices:<ul id="ul_bdq_sj4_llb">
                    <li>After the list of available XML elements is shown, you can press the
                          <uicontrol><shortcut>ESC</shortcut></uicontrol> key to close it and
                      continue to manually insert the XML tag.</li>
                    <li>You can disable the content completion list from the <menucascade>
                        <uicontrol>Options</uicontrol>
                        <uicontrol>Preferences</uicontrol>
                        <uicontrol>Editor / Content Completion</uicontrol>
                      </menucascade> page by deselecting <uicontrol>Enable Content
                        Completion</uicontrol>. After the content completion is disabled, you can
                      force it to be displayed by using the
                          <uicontrol><shortcut>Ctrl+Space</shortcut></uicontrol> keyboard
                      shortcut.</li>
                  </ul></p>
                <p>In addition, using the <menucascade>
                    <uicontrol>Window</uicontrol>
                    <uicontrol>Show view</uicontrol>
                  </menucascade> submenu, you can change focus to the
                    <uicontrol>Attributes</uicontrol>, <uicontrol>Elements</uicontrol>, or
                    <uicontrol>Outline</uicontrol> view. The <uicontrol>Attributes</uicontrol> view
                  presents the existing and possible attributes that can be inserted in an XML tag.
                  The <uicontrol>Elements</uicontrol> view shows you the list of XML elements that
                  can be inserted at the cursor position (also, pressing
                      <uicontrol><shortcut>F2</shortcut></uicontrol> on a selected element presents
                  its annotation). The <uicontrol>Outline</uicontrol> view shows the current path in
                  the XML structure.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><uicontrol>Author</uicontrol> mode is useful for reviewing written XML content
                  because it has support for change tracking and for adding comments. Editing in the
                    <uicontrol>Author</uicontrol> visual editing mode, you have access to only the
                  text content in the XML document.</p>
                <p>Pressing <uicontrol><shortcut>Shift+F2</shortcut></uicontrol> will read the
                  current element context where the cursor is located. Pressing
                      <uicontrol><shortcut>Ctrl+Shift+F3</shortcut></uicontrol> will read the
                  current element context and the entire path in the XML structure where the cursor
                  is located. You can also use the <uicontrol>Outline</uicontrol> view to better
                  understand the XML structure. </p>
                <p>In the <uicontrol>Author</uicontrol> editing mode, you can also use the
                    <uicontrol>Attributes</uicontrol> and <uicontrol>Elements</uicontrol> views
                  similar to using them in the <uicontrol>Text</uicontrol> editing mode. Pressing
                      <uicontrol><shortcut>Enter</shortcut></uicontrol> in the
                    <uicontrol>Author</uicontrol> visual editing mode can also be used to present a
                  list of allowed elements at the current position.</p>
