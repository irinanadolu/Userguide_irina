      <title>Pre-Upgrade Notes</title>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>System requirements: On the server running Content Fusion, you need enough disk space
            to create a backup. The backup file contains a compressed archive of all files located
            in <filepath>/fusion/data/</filepath>, so to be safe, the free space should be at least
            equal to the size of the data folder.</li>
          <li>You cannot upgrade <b>Content Fusion</b> on the existing server. It needs to be
            installed on a new server and all tasks and configurations will be imported to the new
            server during the upgrade process.</li>
          <li>Custom frameworks and plugins will need to be reinstalled manually on the new
            server.</li>
          <li>The upgrade process will involve some downtime, so pick a time that does not affect
            the users.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <title>Upgrade Procedure</title>
      <ol>
        <li>Deploy the new version of Content Fusion on a new server according to the appropriate
          deployment method:<ul>
            <li><xref href="cf-vmsphere.dita"/></li>
            <li><xref href="cf-aws.dita"/></li>
            <li><xref href="cf-linux.dita"/></li>
          </ul></li>
        <li>Once the <b>new server</b> is ready, <xref href="cf-custom-frameworks.dita">reinstall
            any custom Web Author frameworks or plugins</xref> that you were using on the old
          server.</li>
        <li><xref href="cf-enterprise-configuration.dita#cf-enterprise-configuration/maintenance"
            >Enable maintenance mode</xref> on the <b>old server</b>. Maintenance mode is needed to
          ensure that users are not making any changes to the tasks while the backup is being
          created.</li>
        <li>
          <p>Create a backup of the old server by running the following command on the <b>old
              server</b>:<codeblock xml:space="preserve" outputclass="language-javascript">sudo bash /fusion/admin/create-fusion-backup.sh</codeblock></p>
          <p>This will create a backup archive <codeph>fusion-backup.tar.gz</codeph> in the current
            directory. If the backup file already exists, it will be overwritten.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Copy the <codeph>fusion-backup.tar.gz</codeph> backup file to the <b>newly deployed
            server</b>.</li>
        <li>
          <p>On the <b>newly deployed server</b>, run the following command to restore the
            backup:<codeblock xml:space="preserve" outputclass="language-javascript">sudo bash /fusion/admin/restore-fusion-backup.sh /path/to/fusion-backup.tar.gz</codeblock>where
            the path to the backup file is updated to match your situation. </p>
          <p><b>Step Result:</b> After restoring the backup, all the user tasks and configurations
            will be available in the new <b>Content Fusion</b> server.<note type="important">This
              means that the password for the <xref href="cf-enterprise-configuration.dita"
                scope="external">Administration Web Page</xref> on the new server will be the same
              as on the old server.</note></p>
        </li>
        <li>Because the backup was created while maintenance mode was enabled, the new <b>Content
            Fusion</b> server will be in maintenance mode after the backup restore. Go to the <xref
            href="cf-enterprise-configuration.dita#cf-enterprise-configuration/maintenance"
            >Administration Page and disable maintenance mode</xref>.</li>
        <li>To test the upgrade, check to make sure the tasks and configurations that were present
          on the old server are now present on the new server.<note>Depending on the configuration,
            you may have to configure your mail server to accept emails from the new Content Fusion
            server.</note></li>
        <li>Replace the old server with the new one.</li>
