    <p><ph keyref="product"/> is a flexible, intuitive collaboration solution designed to adapt to
      virtually any type of workflow that a collaborative team may use for their documentation
      review process. It provides a platform for a <b>Content Author</b> to upload documents that
      need to be reviewed, the <b>Reviewers</b> simply follow a link to access the documents in a
      browser where they can review the content, add comments, or contribute changes. They can
      communicate with the <b>Content Author</b> or other <b>Reviewers</b> directly from the <ph
        keyref="product"/> interface and ultimately, the <b>Content Author</b> has access to a
      built-in <i>Merge</i> tool to automatically integrate all of the changes back into
        <term>Oxygen XML Editor/Author</term>.</p>
    <p>Since every team has their own specific methods of collaborating, <ph keyref="product"/> was
      designed to be as flexible as possible so that it can be used and integrated into any
      documentation workflow. Thus, you can use whatever type of workflow you want, but the most
      common and basic use-case is something like this:<ol>
        <li>The <b>Content Author</b> has written some content that needs to be reviewed by
          others.</li>
        <li>The <b>Content Author</b> creates a task, attaches the files, and uploaded a snapshot of
          them to the <ph keyref="product"/> server.</li>
        <li>The <b>Content Author</b> shares a link to the task with a <b>Reviewer</b>.</li>
        <li>The <b>Reviewer</b> follows the link to open the <ph keyref="product"/> interface in a
          browser where they can access the task.</li>
        <li>The <b>Reviewer</b> clicks on the files to open them in an online visual editor where
          they can proofread, add comments, and make changes.</li>
        <li>Once they are finished, the <b>Reviewer</b> simply clicks the <uicontrol>Finalize
            Review</uicontrol> button or adds a message in the <ph keyref="product"/> interface to
          let the <b>Content Author</b> know they are finished.</li>
        <li>The <b>Content Author</b> can compare changes made by the <b>Reviewer</b> by using a
            <i>diff</i> link that is available in the left-side activity stream for every file
          change.</li>
        <li>The <b>Content Author</b> pulls the changes and automatically merges the snapshot back
          into the original documentation.</li>
        <li>The <b>Content Author</b> accepts or rejects the suggested changes and commits to their
          repository.</li>
      </ol></p>
