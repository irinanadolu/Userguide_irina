      <p>The <uicontrol>Oxygen Content Fusion Connector</uicontrol> add-on requires a deployed
        Enterprise server, or you can evaluate the product for a limited time using the Evaluation
        server hosted by <term>Oxygen</term>:<dl>

              <p>The <ph keyref="cfEnterprise"/> solution allows you to host your own server to
                store content that is uploaded through the <ph keyref="product"/> connector add-on.
                With this model, you will be able to set up and configure your own server. This
                solution also allows you to <xref
                  href="cf-custom-frameworks.dita#cf-custom-frameworks">upload custom
                  frameworks</xref> so that all contributors will have access to them when reviewing
                content in <ph keyref="product"/>. You also have the ability to extend the
                functionality through plugins and configure various options.</p>

            <dt><ph keyref="cfPublic"/> (https://fusion.oxygenxml.com)</dt>
            <dd>This solution is a service where content that is uploaded through the <ph
                keyref="product"/> connector add-on is stored on an Evaluation server hosted by
                <term>Oxygen</term>. This solution allows you to try <ph keyref="product"/> for free
              for 60 days but you cannot control the server configuration and your documents will be
              uploaded to a shared server (it is recommended that you use sample documents that do
              not contain sensitive information or ownership rights).</dd>
