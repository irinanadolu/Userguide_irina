    <p>When the Unicode characters that are visible in a text viewer or editor are not enough and
      you need to see the byte values of each character of a document, you can start the
        <uicontrol>Hex Viewer</uicontrol> that is available on the <uicontrol>Tools</uicontrol>
      menu. It has two panels: the characters are rendered in the right panel and the bytes of each
      character are displayed in the left panel. There is a 1:1 correspondence between the
      characters and their byte representation: the byte representation of a character is displayed
      in the same matrix position of the left panel as the character in the matrix of the right
      panel.</p>

    </p>
    <p>To open a file in <uicontrol>Hex Viewer</uicontrol> use the <menucascade>
        <uicontrol>File</uicontrol>
        <uicontrol>Open</uicontrol>
      </menucascade> action. Alternatively, you can drag a file and drop it in the <uicontrol>Hex
        Viewer</uicontrol> panel.</p>
