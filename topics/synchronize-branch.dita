  <title>Synchronize a Branch</title>
  <taskbody>
    <context>
      <p>While working on your own branch, other people on your team might continue to make
        important changes in the parent branch (which can be the <i>trunk</i> itself or any other
        branch). It is recommended to periodically duplicate those changes in your branch to make
        sure your changes are compatible with them. This is done by performing a <i>synchronize
          merge</i>, which will bring your branch up-to-date with any changes made to its ancestral
        parent branch since your branch was last created or synchronized. Subversion is aware of the
        history of your branch and can detect when it split away from the parent branch.</p>
      <p>Frequently keeping your branch in sync with the parent branch helps you to prevent
        unexpected conflicts when the time comes for you to duplicate your changes back into the
        parent branch. The synchronization uses <i>merge tracking</i> to skip all those revisions
        that have already been merged, thus a sync merge can be repeated periodically to fetch all
        the latest changes of the parent branch to keep up-to-date with it.</p>
      <p>
        <note type="important">It is recommended to synchronize the whole working copy that was
          created from the child branch (the root of the working copy), rather than just a part of
          it.</note>
      </p>
      <p>After running the <i>synchronize merge</i>, your working copy from the child branch now
        contains new local modifications, and these edits are duplications of all of the changes
        that have happened on the <i>trunk</i> since you first created your branch. At this point,
        your private branch is now synchronized with the trunk.</p>
      <p>To synchronize your branch with its parent branch, follow these steps: </p>
