    <p>The <uicontrol>Rename</uicontrol> action is available in the contextual menu of the <xref
        href="working-copy-view.dita"><uicontrol>Working Copy</uicontrol> view</xref> and can be
      performed on a single resource. This action acts as a move command with the destination
      directory being the same as the original location of the resource. A copy of the original item
      is created with the new name, also keeping its history. The original item is marked as
        <i>deleted</i>.<note><i>External</i> items cannot be renamed using the
          <uicontrol>Rename</uicontrol> action because they cannot be deleted. Instead, you should
        edit the <i>svn:externals</i> property defining the <i>external</i> item, then
        use the <uicontrol>Update</uicontrol> operation on the item's parent folder for the change
        to take effect.</note><note type="attention" id="svn1_8_commit_moved_renamed_items">For SVN
        1.8 working copies: when committing items that were moved and/or renamed, make sure you
        select both the source and the destination. Otherwise, the commit operation will
        fail.</note></p>
