        <p>In typography, an <i>orphan</i> is the first line of a paragraph that appears alone at
      the bottom of a page (the paragraph continues on a subsequent page), while a <i>widow</i> is
      the last line of a paragraph that appears alone at the top of a page. The default is 2 for
      each of them. You can control this number by adding the following to your <xref
        href="dcpp_the_customization_css.dita">customization CSS</xref>:</p>
        <codeblock outputclass="language-css">:root {
    widows:4;
    orphans:4;
}</codeblock>
    <p>
      <note>As a difference from the W3C standard, the <codeph>widows</codeph> and
          <codeph>orphans</codeph> CSS properties are applied to lists as well (the default is 2).
        This means that a list that spans consecutive pages will have either zero or at least 2
        lines on each of the pages.</note>
