    <p>If you click the <uicontrol>Manage sites</uicontrol> link at the top-right corner of the
        <uicontrol>Sites</uicontrol> pane in the <uicontrol>Dashboard</uicontrol> page, it opens
      site management page. This page displays each site configurations as a tile. Each tile
      displays the logo, name, and description for the particular site configuration. The avatar for
      the site <i>Owner</i> is displayed at the top-right corner of each tile (you can hover over
      the avatar to see their name). Also, if the site configuration has the <xref
        href="ofb-editing-site.dita#ofb-editing-site/comment-moderation"><uicontrol>Comment
          Moderation</uicontrol> option enabled</xref>, the number of pending comments is displayed
      if users have posted comments that have not yet been moderated. The tiles for site
      configurations are sorted with pending or open comments listed first and the second sorting
      criterion is to then order them by those that have comments added most recently.</p>
    <p>You can use the drop-down menu at the top-left part of the page to filter the sites by:
        <uicontrol>All sites</uicontrol>, <uicontrol>Sites owned by me</uicontrol>, <uicontrol>Sites
        administered by me</uicontrol>, or <uicontrol>Sites moderated by me</uicontrol>.</p>
    <p>You can click anywhere in the center box of a tile to open the <xref
        href="ofb-moderating-comments.dita"><uicontrol>Comments</uicontrol> page</xref> for that
      particular configuration. This page is used to moderate and manage comments. You can click the
          <uicontrol><image href="../img/ofb-Settings17.png" id="image_gmj_s5y_fjb"
        />Settings</uicontrol> button at the bottom-right corner of a tile to open the
        <uicontrol>General Settings</uicontrol> page for that particular configuration. This page is
      where you can edit the logo, name, or description of a site configuration and it includes some
      other options that can be set according to your needs.</p>
    <p>This page also includes the <uicontrol>Add site</uicontrol> button at the top-right corner.
      You can click this button to <xref href="ofb-creating-site.dita">create a site
        configuration</xref>. If you have a lot of site configurations, you can use the
        <uicontrol>Search</uicontrol> bar to filter the tiles. The filter component looks for the
      entered search terms in the name and description of the site configurations.</p>
