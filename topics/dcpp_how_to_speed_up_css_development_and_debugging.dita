  <title>How to Speed up CSS Development and Debugging</title>
  <taskbody>
    <context id="context_vtz_2kn_cfb">
      <p>You can speed up your CSS development considerably by not invoking the entire pipeline of
        transforming your DITA maps to PDF. Instead, you can use the <xref
          href="dcpp_debugging_the_css.dita#dcpp_debugging_the_css/merged_map_file">merged
          map</xref> and transform it directly to PDF. </p>
    </context>
    <steps>
      <step>
        <cmd>Transform your DITA Map to PDF using the <uicontrol keyref="pdf-html5-transformation"/>
          transformation scenario.</cmd>
      </step>
      <step>
        <cmd>Open the <xref
            href="dcpp_debugging_the_css.dita#dcpp_debugging_the_css/merged_map_file">merged
            file</xref> (*.merged.html) that is located in the output directory in the editor.</cmd>
      </step>
      <step>
        <cmd>Configure an <uicontrol>XML to PDF transformation with CSS</uicontrol> scenario. Do not
          set CSS files here since the merged file already contains pointers to the stylesheets.
          This scenario uses the Chemistry CSS processor.</cmd>
      </step>
      <step importance="optional">
        <cmd>Enable the output of the CSS processor using the following preferences page: <menucascade>
            <uicontrol>Options</uicontrol>
            <uicontrol>Preferences</uicontrol>
            <uicontrol>XML</uicontrol>
            <uicontrol>PDF Processors</uicontrol>
            <uicontrol>CSS Processor</uicontrol>
          </menucascade>.</cmd>
      </step>
    </steps>
    <result id="result_nrt_1mn_cfb">
      <p>Now you can make incremental changes to the CSS stylesheet and quickly see the results by
        transforming the merged file directly.<note type="fastpath">If your changes involve only
          element styling, with no specific paged media CSS rules and properties, you can simply
          open the merged file in a browser (such as Chrome or Firefox) and refresh at each CSS
          change, as shown in: <xref href="dcpp_debugging_the_css.dita"/>.</note></p>
