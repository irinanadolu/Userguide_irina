  <title>History Filter Dialog Box</title>
  <body>
    <p>The <uicontrol>History view</uicontrol> does not always show all the changes ever made to a
      resource because there may be thousands of changes and retrieving the entire list can take a
      long time. Normally you are interested in the more recent ones. That is why you can specify
      the criteria for the revisions displayed in the <uicontrol>History view</uicontrol> by
      selecting one of several options presented in the <uicontrol>History</uicontrol> dialog box
      that is displayed when you invoke the <uicontrol>Show History</uicontrol> action.</p>

    <p>Options for the set of revisions presented in the History view are: <ul>
        <li>All revisions of the selected resource.</li>
        <li>Only revisions between a start revision number and an end revision number.</li>
        <li>Only revisions added in a period of time (such as today, last week, last month,
          etc.)</li>
        <li>Only revisions between a start and an end date.</li>
        <li>Only revisions committed by a specified SVN user.</li>
      </ul></p>
    <p>The toolbar of the <uicontrol>History view</uicontrol> has two buttons for extending the set
      of revisions presented in the view: <uicontrol>Get next 50</uicontrol> and <uicontrol>Get
        all</uicontrol>.</p>
