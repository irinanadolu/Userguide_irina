  <title>Gray Window on Linux With the Compiz / Beryl Window Manager</title>
  <troublebody><condition id="problem">
      <title>Problem</title>
      <p>I try to run <ph keyref="product"/> on Linux with the Compiz / Beryl window manager but I
        only get a gray window that does not respond to user actions. Sometimes the <ph
          keyref="product"/> window responds to user actions but after opening and closing an <ph
          keyref="product"/> dialog, or after resizing the <ph keyref="product"/> window or a view
        of the <ph keyref="product"/> window, the content of this window becomes gray and it does
        not respond to user actions.</p>

      <cause id="cause">
        <title>Cause</title>
        <p>Sun Microsystems' Java virtual machine <xref
            href="http://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6429775" scope="external"
            format="html">does not support the Compiz window manager and the Beryl one very
            well</xref>. It is expected that better support for Compiz / Beryl will be added in
          future versions of their Java virtual machine.</p>

      <title>Solution</title>
        <steps-informal>
          <p>Try turning off the special effects for the Compiz / Beryl window manager before
            starting the <ph keyref="product"/> application or switch to another window manager.</p>
