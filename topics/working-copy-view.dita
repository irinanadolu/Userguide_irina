        <p>The <uicontrol>Working Copy</uicontrol> view allows you to manage the content of an SVN
      working copy. <ph conkeyref="reusables-user-guide/reopen-view"/></p>
        <p>The toolbar contains the following:<ul id="ul_p11_cng_hf" irina="irina">
        <li>The list of defined working copies.</li>
        <li>A set of view modes that allow you to filter the content of the working copy based on
          the resource status (such as incoming or outgoing changes).</li>
        <li><uicontrol>Settings</uicontrol> menu.</li>
      </ul></p>
        <p>If you click any of the view modes (<uicontrol>All Files</uicontrol>,
        <uicontrol>Modified</uicontrol>, <uicontrol>Incoming</uicontrol>,
        <uicontrol>Outgoing</uicontrol>, <uicontrol>Conflicts</uicontrol>), the information
      displayed changes as follows:<ul irina="irina">

            structure with the root of the tree representing the location of the working copy on the
            file system. Each resource has an icon representation that describes the type of
            resource and also depicts the state of that resource with a small overlay icon.</p>

                    <li>The file was locked by the same user from another working copy.</li>
                    <li>The file was locked from the <uicontrol>Repositories</uicontrol> view.</li>
                  </ul></p>
                <p>If you try to commit a new revision of the file to the repository, the server
                  does not allow you to bypass the file lock.<note>To commit a new revision, you
                    need to wait for the file to be unlocked. Ultimately, you might try to
                      <i>break</i> or <i>steal</i> the lock, but this is not what other users
                    expect. Use these actions carefully, especially when you are not the file lock
                    owner.</note></p>

              <li><i>locked</i> ( <image href="../img/SVNLockLocal10.png" id="image_lnj_vv1_tc"/> )
                - displayed after you have locked a file from the current working copy. Now you have
                exclusive rights over the corresponding file, being the only one who can commit
                changes to the file in the repository.<note>Working copies keep track of their
                  locked files, so the locks are presented between different sessions of the
                  application. Synchronize your working copy with the repository to make sure that
                  the locks are still valid (not <i>stolen</i> or <i>broken</i>).</note></li>
              <li><i>stolen</i> ( <image href="../img/SVNLockStolen10.png" id="image_j11_dw1_tc"/> )
                - a file already locked from your working copy is being locked by another user. Now
                the owner of the file lock is the user who stole the lock from you.</li>
              <li><i>broken</i> ( <image href="../img/SVNLockBroken10.png" id="image_tpm_3w1_tc"/> )
                - a file already locked from your working copy is no longer locked in the repository
                (it was unlocked by another user).<note>To remove the <i>stolen</i> or <i>broken</i>
                  states from your working copy files, you have to <uicontrol>Update</uicontrol>
                  them.</note></li>
            </ul></p>
          <p>If one of your working copy files is locked, hover the mouse pointer over the lock icon
            to see more information:<ul id="ul_swn_ht1_tc" irina="irina">
              <li>Lock type - current file lock state</li>
              <li>Owner - the name of the user who created the lock</li>
              <li>Date - the date when the user locked the file</li>
              <li>Expires on - date when the lock expires. Lock expiry policy is set in the
                repository options, on the server side</li>

            <note>The working copy table allows you to show or hide any of its columns and also to
                sort its contents by any of the displayed columns. The table header provides a
                contextual menu that allows you to customize the displayed information.</note>
        </p>
        <p>The toolbar contains the following options for switching to a different working copy:</p>
        <ul irina="irina">
            <li><uicontrol>List of Defined Working Copies</uicontrol> - A drop-down menu that
        contains all the working copies <ph keyref="product"/> is aware of. When you select a
        different working copy from the list, the newly selected working copy content is scanned and
        displayed in the <uicontrol>Working Copy</uicontrol> view.</li>
            <li><uicontrol><image href="../img/SvnWCManagerWin16.png" id="image_hyg_l1h_hf"/>Working
          Copies Manager (<image id="image_g44_rmg_hf" href="../img/SvnWCManagerMac16.png"/> on Mac
          OS X)</uicontrol> - Opens a dialog box that displays the working copies <ph
          keyref="product"/> is aware of. In this dialog box, you can add existing working copies or
        remove those you no longer need. If you try to add a folder that is not a valid Subversion
        working copy, <ph keyref="product"/> warns you that the selected directory is not under
        version control. <note>Removing a working copy from this dialog box does NOT remove it from
          your file system; you will have to do that manually.</note></li>
