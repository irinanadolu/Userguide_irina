      viewed by end-users. This process is known as a <i>transformation</i>.</p>

      content in various output formats (such as WebHelp, PDF, CHM, EPUB, JavaHelp, Eclipse Help,
      XHTML, etc.) </p>

      />, simply install the tool chain required to perform the specific transformation and process
      the files in accordance with the processor instructions. A multitude of target formats are
