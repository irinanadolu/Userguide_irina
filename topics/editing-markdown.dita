    <p><b>Markdown</b> was created as a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting
      syntax designed to provide syntax that is very easy to read and write, and to convert it to
      HTML and other formats. It is often used by content contributors who want a quick and easy way
      to write content without having to take their fingers off the keyboard and without having to
      learn numerous codes or shortcuts, and it can easily be shared interchangeably between
      virtually any types of contributor and system.</p>
    <p><ph keyref="product"/> provides a built-in Markdown editor that allows you to convert
      Markdown syntax to HTML or DITA and it includes a preview panel to help you visualize the
      final output. Aside from the plain text syntax that is common among most Markdown
      applications, the editor in <ph keyref="product"/> also integrates many other powerful
      features that content authors are accustomed to using for other types of documents. Some of
