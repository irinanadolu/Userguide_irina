        <p>When documenting large projects, it is likely that there are multiple people involved. In
      this case, it is usually more efficient to using a modular approach so that everyone involved
      in the project can work in parallel. Other advantages of modular documentation include:
      reusable content possibilities, smaller file units are easier to edit, and better version
      control.</p>
        <p>Two possible solutions for this are to use <b>DTD  Entities</b> or <b>XInclude</b> to
      combine XML content in a <xref keyref="glossentry_master-file"><term>master
      file</term></xref>. A master document can be created with references to various document
      parts, users can edit those documents individually, and then apply an XSLT stylesheet over the
      master document to obtain the output files in various formats (for example, PDF or HTML).</p>
