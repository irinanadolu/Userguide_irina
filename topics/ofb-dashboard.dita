    <p>The first time you log in to the administration interface, you are directed to a Welcome page
      where you can click the <uicontrol>Add your first site</uicontrol> button to <xref
        href="ofb-creating-site.dita">create your first site configuration</xref>. After you have
      created at least one site configuration, you start with the <uicontrol>Dashboard</uicontrol>
      page on all subsequent logins. This page is especially helpful for those who integrate the
      Feedback commenting component in multiple websites. It aggregates basic information about your
      existing site configurations.<note product="feedback-enterprise">The
          <uicontrol>Dashboard</uicontrol> page is slightly different for <term
          keyref="glossentry_fb_platform_admin">Feedback Platform Admin</term>. They have access to
        their own <xref href="ofbENT-admin-area.dita">special <uicontrol>Admin
          Area</uicontrol></xref> that is reached by clicking the <image
          href="../img/ofb-Admin18.png" id="image_k5w_vjp_ymb"/> button on the right side of the top
        ribbon.</note></p>
    <p product="feedback">There is a drop-down menu at the top that you can use to filter the
        <uicontrol>Dashboard</uicontrol> by all your site configurations, or sites that you are
      assigned as the <i>Owner</i>, or sites that you are assigned as an <i>Admin</i> or
        <i>Moderator</i>.</p>

            <p>The <uicontrol>Sites</uicontrol> pane displays all the existing site configurations
