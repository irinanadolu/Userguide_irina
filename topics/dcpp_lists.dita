    <title>Lists</title>

    <p>You can style the list item markers or other properties.</p>
		<p>
			<note>The lists are treated differently than ordinary block elements in the sense that their
        margins are not collapsed with the margins of the neighboring blocks or lists. This is also
        visible for nested lists.</note>
