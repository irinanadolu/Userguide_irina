        <p>If you want to access a WebDAV repository across a non-secure network, <ph
        keyref="product"/> allows you to load and save the documents over the HTTPS protocol (if the
      server understands this protocol) so that any data exchange with the WebDAV server is
      encrypted.</p>
        <p>When a WebDAV repository is first accessed over HTTPS, the server hosting the repository
            will present a security certificate as part of the HTTPS protocol, without any user
            intervention. <ph keyref="product"/> will
            use this certificate to decrypt any data stream received from the server. For the
            authentication to succeed you should make sure the security certificate of the server
            hosting the repository can be read by <ph
                keyref="product"/>. This means that <ph
                keyref="product"/> can find the
            certificate in the key store of the Java Runtime Environment where it runs. You know
            the server certificate is not in the JRE key store if you get the error <i>No trusted
                certificate found</i> when trying to access the WebDAV repository.</p>
