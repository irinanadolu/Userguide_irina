    <p>The <xref href="https://styles.oxygenxml.com/" format="html" scope="external"><b>Oxygen
          Styles Basket</b></xref> is a web-based application designed to help you generate CSS
      customizations. </p>
    <p>It is based on galleries that you can use to pick and mix styling aspects to create a custom
      look and feel. Various different types of aspects can be selected to be integrated in the CSS
      stylesheet (such as fonts, tables, lists, spacing, code, etc.) and then downloaded as a CSS
      file (or as a publishing template file).</p>
    <p>It is also possible to re-upload a previously generated CSS for further customization.</p>
