        <p>The options used in the SVN client are saved and loaded independently from the <ph
        keyref="product"/> options. However, if <ph keyref="product"/> cannot determine a set of SVN
      options to be loaded at startup, some of the preferences are imported from the XML Editor
      options (such as the License key and HTTP Proxy settings).</p>
        <p>There is also an additional set of preferences applied to the SVN client that are set in
      global SVN files. There are two editing actions available in the <uicontrol>Global Runtime
        Configuration</uicontrol> submenu of the <uicontrol>Options</uicontrol> menu. These actions,
        <uicontrol>Edit 'config' file</uicontrol> and <uicontrol>Edit 'servers' file</uicontrol>,
      contain parameters that act as defaults applied to all the SVN client tools that are used by
      the same user on their login account.</p>
