        <title>Cause</title>
        <p>Some anti-virus software can cause Java applications, such as <ph keyref="product"/>, to
          start very slowly due to scanning compressed archives (such as the <term>JAR</term>
          libraries that all Java applications use).</p>
      </cause>
      <remedy id="solution">
        <title>Solution</title>
        <steps-informal>
          <p>A possible solution is to add the <ph keyref="product"/> folder to the list of
            exceptions in the anti-virus software settings.</p>
