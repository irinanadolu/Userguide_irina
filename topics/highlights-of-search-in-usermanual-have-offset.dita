  <title>Wrong Words are Highlighted when Searching in a User Manual</title>
  <troublebody><condition id="problem">
      <title>Problem</title>
      <p>When I do a keyword search in the User Manual that is included with the <ph
          keyref="product"/> application, the search highlights the wrong word in the text.
        Sometimes the highlighted word is several words after the matched word.</p>
    </condition><troubleSolution>
      <cause id="cause">
        <title>Cause</title>
        <p>This does not happen when <ph keyref="product"/> runs with a built-in Java virtual
          machine that was installed by <ph keyref="product"/> in a subfolder of the installation
          folder (for example, on Windows and Linux when installing <ph keyref="product"/> with the
          installation wizard specific for that platform). However, when <ph keyref="product"/> runs
          from an All Platforms installation, it uses whatever JVM was found on the host system,
          which may be incompatible with the JavaHelp indexer used for creating the built-in User
          Manual. Such a JVM may offset the highlight of the matched word with several characters,
          usually to the right of the matched word.</p>

        <steps-informal>
          <p>To see the highlight the exact matched word, it is recommended to install the
            application with the specific installation wizard for your platform (available only for
            Windows and Linux).</p>
