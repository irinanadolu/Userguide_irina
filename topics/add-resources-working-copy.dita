    <p>To share new files and folders (created in your working copy), add them to version control
      using the <uicontrol>Add to version control</uicontrol> option from the <xref
        href="working-copy-view.dita"><uicontrol>Working Copy</uicontrol> view</xref>. </p>
    <p>You can easily spot resources not under version control by the <term>unversioned</term>
        (<image href="../img/SVNWCUnversioned10.png" id="image_xwn_1z5_5r"/>) icon displayed in the
          <uicontrol><image href="../img/SVNLocalContentStatusColumnHeader.png"/>Local file
        status</uicontrol> column. Resources scheduled for addition are displayed with this
        <term>added</term> (<image href="../img/SVNWCAdded10.png" id="image_lny_pjp_5r"/>) icon in
      the <uicontrol>Working Copy</uicontrol> view and are added in the repository after you commit
      them. <note>Do not make a confusion between <image href="../img/SVNWCAddedWithHistory10.png"/>
        and <image href="../img/SVNWCAdded10.png" id="image_cx2_qjp_5r"/> icons. The former icon
        stands for resources that are actually copies of resources already committed in the
        repository, meaning they are <i>scheduled for addition with history</i>.</note></p>
    <p>When you use the <uicontrol>Add to version control</uicontrol> option on a directory, its
      entire structure is scanned and all the resources that can be added under version control are
      presented.</p>
    <p>Although it is not mandatory to add resources under version control explicitly, it is
      recommended. If you forgot to add a resource, when you <xref href="send-changes.dita">commit
        your changes</xref>, the resource is presented in the commit dialog box, but not selected.
      When you commit and <term>unversioned</term> resource, it is automatically added under version
      control before starting the commit operation.</p>

        <title>Add to Version Control Dialog Box</title>
        <image href="../img/svn-add-to-version-control-dialog-box.png"/>
      </fig>
    </p>
    <p>
      <note><term>Ignored</term> (<image href="../img/SVNWCIgnored10.png"/>) items can also be added
        under version control.</note>
    </p>
    <p>The <uicontrol>Depth</uicontrol> column is displayed only when directories are also presented
      in the dialog box. For any directory, you can use one of the available values to instruct
      Subversion to limit the scope of the operation to a particular tree depth.<note>The initial
        value of the <uicontrol>Depth</uicontrol> field can have the following values, depending on
        the <xref href="working-copy-settings.dita#working-copy-settings/view-mode">listing mode of
          the items in the working copy view</xref>:<ul>
          <li><i>infinity</i> - When the working copy items are presented as a tree.</li>
          <li><i>files</i> - When the working copy items are presented compressed.</li>
          <li><i>empty</i> - When the working copy items are presented flat.</li>
        </ul>When you add unversioned or ignored directories, the initial value of the
          <uicontrol>Depth</uicontrol> field also depends on the state of the <uicontrol>Show
          unversioned directories content</uicontrol> and <uicontrol>Show ignored directories
          content</uicontrol> options. If these options are selected, the value is based on the
        listing mode of the items in the working copy view. When they are not selected, the value is
          <i>empty</i>.</note></p>
    <p>The following options are available in this dialog box:<ul>
        <li id="enable-auto-properties"><uicontrol>Enable automatic properties</uicontrol> or
            <uicontrol>Disable automatic properties</uicontrol> - enables or disables automatic
          property assignment (per runtime configuration rules), overriding the
            <codeph>enable-auto-props</codeph> runtime configuration directive, defined in the
            <codeph>config</codeph> file of the Subversion configuration directory.<note>This option
            is available only when there are defined properties to be applied automatically for
            resources newly added under version control. You can define these properties in the
              <codeph>config</codeph> file of the Subversion configuration directory, in the
              <codeph>auto-props</codeph> section. Based on the value of the
              <codeph>enable-auto-props</codeph> runtime configuration directive, the presented
            option is either <uicontrol>Enable automatic properties</uicontrol>, or
              <uicontrol>Disable automatic properties</uicontrol>.</note></li>
        <li id="no-ignore"><uicontrol>No ignore</uicontrol> - when you select this option, file-name
          patterns defined to ignore <term>unversioned</term> resources do not apply. Resources that
          are located inside an <term>unversioned</term> directory selected for addition, and match
          these patterns, are also scheduled for addition in the repository.<note>This option is
            available only when directories are also presented in the dialog box.<p>You can define
              file-name patterns to ignore <term>unversioned</term> resources in one of the
              following locations:<ul>
                <li>In the <codeph>config</codeph> file of the Subversion configuration directory
                  (the <codeph>global-ignores</codeph> option from the <codeph>miscellany</codeph>
                  section).</li>
                <li>In the <ph keyref="product"/> options (<ph
                    conkeyref="reusables-preferences-pages/open-the-preferences-page"/> and go to <menucascade>
                    <uicontrol>SVN</uicontrol>
                    <uicontrol>Working copy</uicontrol>
                    <uicontrol>Application global ignores</uicontrol>
                  </menucascade>).</li>
              </ul></p></note></li>
      </ul></p>
    <p>Each of the above two options is activated only when you select an item that can have the option
      applied.</p>
