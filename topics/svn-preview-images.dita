    <p>You can view your local files by using the built-in <uicontrol>Image Preview</uicontrol>
      component. The view can be accessed from the <xref href="working-copy-view.dita">Working copy
        view</xref> or from the <xref href="repository-view.dita">Repository view</xref>. It can
      also be used from the <xref href="history-view.dita">History view</xref> to view a selected
      revision of a image file. </p>
    <p>Only one image file can be opened at a time. If an image file is opened in the <i>Image
        preview</i> and you try to open another one it will be opened in the same window. Supported
      image types are <i>GIF</i>, <i>JPEG/JPG</i>, <i>PNG</i>, <i>BMP</i>. Once the image is
      displayed in the <uicontrol>Image Preview</uicontrol> panel using the actions from the
      contextual menu, you can scale the image at its original size (<uicontrol>1:1</uicontrol>
      action) or scale it down to fit in the view's available area (<uicontrol>Scale to
        fit</uicontrol> action).</p>
