  <title>Resolving Merge Conflicts</title>
  <body>
    <p>After the merge operation is finished, it is possible to have some items in conflict. This
      means that some incoming modifications for an item could not be merged with the current
      working copy version. If there are such conflicts, the <uicontrol>Merge conflicts</uicontrol>
      dialog box will appear, presenting the items that are in conflict. This dialog box offers you
      choices for resolving the conflicts.</p>

    <p>The options to resolve a conflict are as follows:</p>
    <ul id="ul_zg1_phy_4r">
      <li><uicontrol>Resolve later</uicontrol> - Used for leaving the conflict as it is, to manually
        resolve it later.</li>
      <li><uicontrol>Keep incoming</uicontrol> - This option keeps all the incoming modifications
        and discards all current ones from your working copy.</li>
      <li><uicontrol>Keep outgoing</uicontrol> - This option keeps all current modifications from
        your working copy and discards all incoming ones.</li>
      <li><uicontrol>Mark resolved</uicontrol> - You should choose this option after you have
        manually solved the conflict, to instruct the Subversion that it was resolved. To do this,
        use the <uicontrol>Edit conflict</uicontrol> button, which displays a dialog box that
        presents the contents of the conflicting items (the content of the working copy version
        versus the incoming version).</li>
