      <title>License Usage Statistics Page (Floating License Only)</title>
      <p>This report page provides some usage statistics for the floating licenses. It is helpful
        for determining the number of licenses that are needed and monitoring times when licenses
        are consumed. It includes the following information:<ul irina="irina">
          <li><b>Maximum number of concurrent licenses</b> - Shows the maximum number of floating
            licenses that can be consumed at any given time.</li>
          <li>
            <p><b>Concurrent license consumption per day</b> - A chart that shows the peak number of
              licenses that were consumed and the total number of users that were rejected, on a
              daily basis. This chart can be used to detect the amount of concurrent licenses that
              are needed to avoid having rejected users.<note type="tip">You can click on any bar to
                see the license consumption per hour for that particular day.</note></p>

      <title>Users Management Page (Named-User License Only)</title>
      <p>When using a named-user license key, the license server allocates available licenses on a
          <i>first come first served</i> basis until the maximum number is reached. Further users
        attempting to get a license key will be rejected.</p>
      <p>This page provides access to the list of registered users and allows the server admin to:<ul irina="irina">
          <li>Revoke a user's right to use a license.</li>
          <li>Reactivate a previously deactivated user.</li>
