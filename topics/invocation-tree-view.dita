    <p>The <uicontrol>Invocation Tree</uicontrol> view shows a top-down call tree that represents
      how XSLT instructions or XQuery expressions are processed. <ph
        conkeyref="reusables-user-guide/reopen-view"/></p>
    <p>

      </fig>
    </p>
    <p>The entries in the invocation tree include a few possible icons that indicate the
      following:</p>
    <ul irina="irina">
      <li><uicontrol><image href="../img/PArrowDown16.png" id="image_n1n_j2n_wr"/></uicontrol> -
        Points to a call whose inherent time is insignificant compared to its total time.</li>
      <li><uicontrol><image href="../img/PClock16.png" id="image_ldh_p2n_wr"/></uicontrol> - Points
        to a call whose inherent time is significant compared to its total time (greater than 1/3rd
        of its total time).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Every entry in the invocation tree includes textual information that depends on the <xref
        href="preferences-profiler.dita"><uicontrol>XSLT/XQuery profiler
      settings</uicontrol></xref>:</p>
    <ul irina="irina">
      <li>A percentage number of the total time that is calculated with respect to either the root
        of the tree or the calling instruction.</li>
      <li>A total time measurement in milliseconds or microseconds. This is the total execution time
        that includes calls into other instructions.</li>
      <li>A percentage number of the inherent time that is calculated with respect to either the
        root of the tree or the calling instruction.</li>
      <li>An inherent time measurement in milliseconds or microseconds. This is the inherent
        execution time of the instruction.</li>
      <li>An invocation count that shows how often the instruction has been invoked on this
        call-path.</li>
      <li>An instruction name that contains also the attributes description.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The <uicontrol>Invocation Tree</uicontrol> view also includes the following contextual menu
        actions:<dl conkeyref="reusables-xslt-xquery/contextual-menu-actions">
        <dlentry>
          <dt/>
          <dd/>
        </dlentry>
