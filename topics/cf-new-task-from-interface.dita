      <title>Creating a New Task from the Content Fusion Interface</title>
      <p>It is possible to create a task directly in the <ph keyref="product"/> browser interface.
        This means that the task creation process is available to anyone who has access to the <ph
          keyref="product"/> browser interface, even if they do not have access to <term>Oxygen XML
          Editor/Author</term>.</p>
      <p>To create a new task from the Content Fusion browser interface, follow these steps:<ol
          id="ol_gzj_4pq_4jb">
          <li>Go to the <ph keyref="product"/> browser interface. If you do not know your base URL
            (for example, <i>https://fusion.oxygenxml.com</i>), you can access it using any link
            that was sent to you in the past.</li>
          <li>
            <p>Log in, if necessary. Then click your user name at the right side of the top ribbon
              and select <uicontrol>My Tasks</uicontrol>.</p>
            <p><b>Step Result:</b> This opens a page that displays a list of all the current tasks
              that are either assigned to you or were created (owned) by you.<note type="tip"
                >Clicking on the <uicontrol><image href="../img/ShowFusion18.png"
                    id="image_jxn_1g3_4jb"/>Oxygen Content Fusion</uicontrol> logo on the left side
                of the top ribbon also opens this page.</note></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Click the <uicontrol>NEW TASK</uicontrol> button.</p>
            <p><b>Step Result:</b> This opens a new <i>Task Details</i> page where you can add a
              title, add new files from templates, retrieve the task link to share with others, and
              more.</p>
          </li>
          <li>Click the text field where it shows <uicontrol>Add a title</uicontrol> to enter a
            description or title for the task.</li>
          <li>Click the <uicontrol>NEW FILE</uicontrol> button to <xref

            you want to review the documents or with a <uicontrol>Content Author</uicontrol> who can
            integrate the new content into their project in <term>Oxygen XML Editor/Author</term>.
            To retrieve the link, you can click the <uicontrol>SHARE</uicontrol> button, then use
            the <uicontrol><image href="../img/CF_Copy18.png" id="image_vnw_z4w_4jb"

      <title>Creating a New File from the Content Fusion Browser Interface</title>
      <p>For any task that you are the owner (tasks you created or were assigned as an owner), you
        have the ability to create a new file from a list of templates. This is done from the
          <i>Task Details</i> page and the newly created file will automatically be added to the
        current task.</p>
      <p>To create a new file from the Content Fusion browser interface, follow these steps:<ol
          id="ol_iqv_bkx_4jb">

          <li>
            <p>Click the <uicontrol>NEW FILE</uicontrol> button.</p>
            <p><b>Step Result:</b> This opens a dialog box where you can select a document template
              to use as a starting point for your new file. Many of the templates include a
              description to help you choose the correct template for your purposes (single-click a
              template to display the description).</p>
          </li>
          <li>Select an appropriate template, choose a file name in the text field at the bottom,
            and click <uicontrol>OK</uicontrol>.<p><b>Step Result:</b> The new file is opened in the
                <xref href="making_changes_to_uploaded_files.dita">visual editor page</xref> with
              some of the XML structure already added for you.</p></li>
          <li>Click on the file name to open it in the <xref

              editor where you can proofread, add comments, and make changes</xref> to the document.
