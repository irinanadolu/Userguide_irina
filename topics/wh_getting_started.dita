    <p><b>WebHelp</b> is a form of online help that consists of a series of web pages (XHTML
      format). Its advantages include platform independence, the ability to update content
      continuously, it can be viewed using a regular web browser, and a comments component can be
      embedded in the output to provide an efficient way to interact with users.</p>
    <p product="webhelp">The <b>WebHelp Classic</b> system is designed for desktop systems and it
      features a familiar <i>tri-pane</i> layout. You can use the system to publish DocBook
      documents and it also includes a WebHelp Skin Builder that provides a simple online tool to
      help you visually customize the look and feel of your WebHelp output.</p>
    <p product="webhelp-responsive">The <b>WebHelp Responsive</b> variant features a very flexible
      layout and is designed to adapt to any device and screen size to provide an optimal viewing
      and interaction experience. It is based upon the <i>Bootstrap</i> responsive front-end
      framework and is available for DITA document types.</p>

        <b>Oxygen XML Editor/Author</b>. This is especially useful if you want to automate the
      output process.</p>
