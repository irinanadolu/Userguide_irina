    <p>When opening <ph keyref="webappProduct"/>, you are greeted with a user-friendly <xref
        href="webapp-create-open-docs.dita#webapp-create-open-docs"
        ><uicontrol>Dashboard</uicontrol></xref> that contains actions that allow you access XML
      files stored in various file repositories. Depending on the repository you chose, follow the
      instructions presented on screen. This section includes information about using <ph
        keyref="webappProduct"/> with Git (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket), WebDAV, SharePoint Online,
      Perforce Helix, IBM Content Navigator, and other file storage services through a generic CMIS
      connector. All of these types of file repositories are integrated with <ph
        keyref="webappProduct"/> through plugins and your system administrator will need to <xref
        href="supported-plugins.dita">enable and configure the particular plugin</xref> to give you
      the ability to access the repository.</p>
