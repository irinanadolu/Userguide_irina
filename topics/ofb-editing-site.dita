    <p>The <uicontrol>General Settings</uicontrol> page is where you can edit the logo, name, or
      description of a site configuration and it includes some other options that can be set
      according to your needs. If you are in the <xref href="ofb-sites-page.dita"
          ><uicontrol>Sites</uicontrol> page</xref>, you can click the <uicontrol><image
          href="../img/ofb-Settings17.png" id="image_gmj_s5y_fjb"/>Settings</uicontrol> button at
      the bottom-right corner of a tile to open this <uicontrol>General Settings</uicontrol> page
      for that particular site configuration. If you are already inside the interface for a
      particular site configuration, you can click the <uicontrol><image
          href="../img/ofb-BlueSettings16.png" id="image_txz_51g_gjb"/>General</uicontrol> link in
      the left menu bar to reach this page.</p>
