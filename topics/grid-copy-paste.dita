    <p>Selecting content in the <uicontrol>Grid</uicontrol> mode is similar to working with any
      table with a little more complexity. Specifically, depending on the type of node, when you
      select a cell, the selection may automatically include additional cells that are implied by
      the currently selected node. For example, if you click a node that contains any child nodes,
      all cells that contain the parent and child nodes will be selected. In this case, the
      currently selected cell is painted with a color that is different from the rest of the
      selection.</p>
    <p>You can also select discontinuous regions of nodes and place them in the clipboard with the
      copy action. To deselect one of the selected fragments, use <uicontrol
        conkeyref="reusable-oxygen-shortcuts-list/ctrl_click"/>.</p>

      <title>Pasting Content Within Grid Mode</title>
      <p>You can paste copied nodes relative to the currently selected cell using one of the
        following actions (available in the contextual menu):<ul irina="irina">
          <li><uicontrol><image href="../img/Paste16.png" id="image_cwr_cqt_tr"/>Paste (<shortcut
                conkeyref="reusable-oxygen-shortcuts-list/ctrl_v_shortcut"/>)</uicontrol> - Pastes
            copied content, as a sibling, just below (after) the current selection.</li>
          <li><uicontrol>Paste as Child</uicontrol> - Pastes copied content as the last child of the
            current selection.</li>
        </ul></p>

      <p>Nodes that are copied from the <uicontrol>Grid</uicontrol> editor can also be pasted into
          <uicontrol>Text</uicontrol> mode or other external applications. When pasting copied
        content from <uicontrol>Grid</uicontrol> mode, the inserted string represents the nodes
        serialization. The nodes from tables can be copied using HTML or RTF in table format. The
        resulting cells contain only the concatenated values of the text nodes.</p>

      <p>You can also paste well-formed XML content or tab-separated values from other editors into
        the <uicontrol>Grid</uicontrol> editor. If you paste XML content, the result will be the
        insertion of the nodes obtained by parsing this content.</p>

        </fig>
      </p>
      <p>If the pasted text contains multiple lines of tab-separated values, it can be considered as
        a matrix of values. By pasting this matrix of values into the <uicontrol>Grid</uicontrol>
        editor, the result will be a matrix of cells. If the operation is performed inside existing
        cells, the existing values will be overwritten and new cells will be created when
        needed.</p>

      </p>
      <p>If you need to add copied content to your existing content (rather than overwriting
        existing cells), you need to first insert new cells by using the <uicontrol><image
            href="../img/TableRow16.gif" id="image_xsq_2xz_tr"/>Insert row</uicontrol> or
            <uicontrol><image href="../img/TableColumn16.gif" id="image_ypw_cxz_tr"/>Insert
          column</uicontrol> actions from the contextual menu. This is useful, for example, when
        trying to transfer data from spreadsheet-like editors to the <uicontrol>Grid</uicontrol>
        editor.</p>
