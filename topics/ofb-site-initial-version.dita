    <p>The second page of the site creation wizard is the <uicontrol>Version</uicontrol> page where
      you must specify a version and the base URL from your website where the WebHelp output is
      deployed.</p>
    <p>This wizard page includes the following options:</p>
    <p>
      <dl>
        <dlentry>
          <dt>Name</dt>
          <dd>This is where you specify the version name or identifier. This is helpful if there
            will be multiple versions for your output. For example, if your published output is
            documentation for a product that has multiple released versions, each version probably
            has its own published documentation. In this case, each published version requires a
            different configuration since the version and base URL would be different for each of
            them. The version can be used later to decide whether or not comments from older
            versions are shown in new published versions. This is managed in the <xref
              href="ofb-version-management.dita"><uicontrol>Site Versions</uicontrol> page</xref>.
            In most cases (especially if you do not plan to have multiple versions), you can leave
            the name of the version as <i>1.0</i>.</dd>
        </dlentry>
        <dlentry>
          <dt>Site Base URL</dt>
          <dd>This is where you specify the base URL for the website where you publish your output.
            For WebHelp output, for example, it is the URL where your WebHelp output is deployed.
            Only <codeph>http</codeph> and <codeph>https</codeph> protocols are allowed and it must
            NOT point to a file (e.g. <filepath>http://example.com/index.html</filepath> is not
              allowed).<note conkeyref="reusables-feedback/site-base-url-note"/></dd>
