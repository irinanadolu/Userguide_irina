    <p>The floating license type is commonly used by organizations that have a large number of
      infrequent users who do not need to use <ph keyref="product"/> all at the same time. Instead
      of each user having their own individual license key to use at their discretion, there are a
      pool of licenses that are used one at a time by various users upon request.</p>
    <p>To use floating licenses, a license server is required and the license key needs to be
      activated. Your system administrator will most likely be responsible for <xref
        keyref="installation_setting-up-license-server">setting up the license server</xref>. Then
      you will need to <xref
        href="request-floating-license-from-license-servlet.dita#request-floating-license-from-license-servlet"
        >request a floating license from the server</xref>. This process is designed to help you
      comply with the <term>Oxygen End-User License Agreement (EULA)</term>. This means that the
      license key will be locked to a particular license server deployment, and the same license key
      cannot be used with any other license server.</p>
    <p>For information about releasing and returning a floating license to the pool for other users,
      see <xref href="release-floating-license.dita#release-floating-license"/>.</p>
    <p>For information about reserving (or locking) a floating license so that it does not get
      returned to the pool, see <xref href="reserve-floating-license.dita#reserve-floating-license"
      />.</p>
