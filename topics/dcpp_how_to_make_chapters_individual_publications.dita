  <title>How to Make Chapters Look Like Individual Publications </title>
  <body>
		<note>This topic is only applicable for the <uicontrol keyref="pdf-html5-transformation"/>
      transformation scenario.</note>
		<p>Sometimes you want to make each chapter independent (i.e. it can be read separately, as a
      separate part of your publication). For this, you need the page counter, figure, and table
      counters to restart at each chapter. You can control this by using the <xref
        href="dcpp_numbering_intro.dita"><codeph>args.css.param.numbering</codeph></xref>
      command-line parameter. </p>
		<p>In addition to numbering, you can force the creation of a <xref
        href="dcpp_table_of_contents_for_chapters.dita">chapter TOC</xref>. </p>
