  <title>Tree Conflicts</title>
  <body>
    <p>A <i>tree conflict</i> is a conflict at the directory tree structure level and occurs when
      the user runs an update action on a resource that has the following conditions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>It is locally modified and the same resource was deleted from the repository (or deleted
        as a result of being renamed or moved).</li>
      <li>It was locally deleted (or deleted as a result of being renamed or moved) and the same
        resource is incoming as modified from the repository.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The same conflict situation can occur after a merge or a switch action. The action ends with
      an error and the folder containing the file that is now in the tree conflict state is also
      marked with a conflict icon.</p>
    <p>Such a conflict can be resolved in one of the following ways that are available when the
      user double clicks on the conflicting resource or when running the <uicontrol>Edit
        conflict</uicontrol> action:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><uicontrol>Keep local change (delete resource)</uicontrol> - Keeps the incoming change
        that comes from the repository.</li>
      <li><uicontrol>Keep incoming modified resource</uicontrol> - If there is a renamed version of
        the file committed by other user that will be added to the working copy too.</li>
    </ul>
