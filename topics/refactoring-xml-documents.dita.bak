    <p>In the life cycle of XML documents there are instances when the XML structure needs to be
      changed to accommodate various needs. For example, when an associated schema is updated, an
      attribute may have been removed, or a new element added to the structure.</p>
    <p>These types of situations cannot be resolved with a traditional <i>Find/Replace</i> tool,
      even if the tool accepts regular expressions. The problem becomes even more complicated if an
      XML document is computed or referenced from multiple modules, since multiple resources need to
      be changed.</p>
    <p>To assist you with these types of refactoring tasks, <ph keyref="product"/> includes a
      specialized <uicontrol>XML Refactoring</uicontrol> tool that helps you manage the structure of
      your XML documents.</p>
    <section id="xml_refactoring_tool">
      <title>XML Refactoring Tool</title>
      <p>The <uicontrol>XML Refactoring</uicontrol> tool is presented in the form of an easy to use
        wizard that is designed to reduce the time and effort required to perform various structure
        management tasks. For example, you can insert, delete, or rename an attribute in all
        instances of a particular element that is found in all documents within your project. </p>
      <p>To access the tool, select the <uicontrol><image href="../img/XMLRefactoring16.png"
            id="image_mv4_ptt_kr"/>XML Refactoring</uicontrol> action from one of the following

              <p>The first wizard page presents the available operations, grouped by category. To
                search for an operation, you can use the filter text box at the top of the page.</p>

                element and the qualified name of the attribute to be removed.</p>
