    <p>One of the advantages of <ph keyref="webappProduct"/> is that it allows contributors (such as
      reviewers or support engineers) to streamline the documentation workflow by proposing changes
      or adding comments directly in the XML source. The documentation team can then easily
      integrate the changes or suggestions without various additional steps being required somewhere
      in the process.</p>
    <p><ph keyref="webappProduct"/> can be launched at any point during your content-related
      workflows by simply embedding a link in a web-page, e-mail message, or even in the published
      output. The user then simply clicks a link, and they will be redirected to the <ph
        keyref="webappProduct"/> editing page with that particular file open and editable.</p>
    <p>You can also streamline and control your workflow by embedding a custom action in the Web
      Author interface. For example, you could configure an action to check a file in or out to make
      the file management process easier for the user.</p>
