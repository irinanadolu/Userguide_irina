      <p>If this is your first time before using <ph keyref="product"/>, you must create an account
        by following these steps:<ol>
          <li>If the Content Fusion server is configured to provide Google or GitHub authentication
            and you have an active Google or GitHub account, you can simply click either of those
            two buttons and allow <ph keyref="product"/> to use those credentials. Otherwise,
            proceed to the next step.<note><ph keyref="product"/> only uses your social account to
              read your name and email address. No other data is accessed.</note><note><ph
                keyref="product"/> requires a valid email address to complete your account sign-up
              process. Even if you choose to log in using a social account, the email address
              associated with that account might not be public (this is the default case for
              GitHub). In this case, <ph keyref="product"/> asks you to provide one.</note></li>
          <li>Click the <uicontrol>SIGN UP</uicontrol> tab and enter your name, a valid email
            address, and a password.</li>
          <li>Click the <uicontrol>I'm not a robot</uicontrol> checkbox.</li>
          <li>Click the <uicontrol>SIGN UP</uicontrol> button at the bottom.</li>
          <li>Open the email that is sent to the email address you entered and use the link to
            verify your email address.</li>
          <li>Click <uicontrol>Authorize</uicontrol> to finalize the account creation process.</li>
