  <title>Real Conflicts vs Mergeable Conflicts</title>
  <body>
    <p>There are two types of conflicts:<ul>
        <li><i>real conflict</i> (<image href="../img/SynchronizeRealConflict.png"/> icon in
            <i>Name</i> column) - <ph keyref="svnProduct"/> considers the following resource states
          to be real conflicts:<ul>
            <li><i>conflicted</i> state - A file reported by SVN as being in this state is obtained
              after it was updated/merged while having incoming and outgoing content or property
              changes at the same time, changes that could not be merged. A content conflict (<image
                href="../img/SVNWCConflicted10.png"/> icon in <i>Local file status</i> column) is
              reported when the modified file has binary content or it is a text file and both local
              and remote changes were found on the same line. A properties conflict (<image
                href="../img/SVNWCPropConflicted10.png"/> icon in <i>Local properties status</i>
              column) is reported when a property's value was modified both locally and
              remotely.</li>
            <li><i>tree conflicted</i> state (<image href="../img/SVNWCTreeConflicted10.png"/> icon
              in <i>Local file status</i> column) - Obtained after an update or merge operation,
              while having changes at the directory structure level (for example, file is locally
              modified and remotely deleted or locally scheduled for deletion and remotely
              modified).</li>
            <li><i>obstructed</i> state (<image href="../img/SVNWCObstructed10.png"/> icon in
                <i>Local file status</i> column) - Obtained after a resource was versioned as one
              kind of object (file, directory, symbolic link), but has been replaced outside Syncro
              SVN Client by a different kind of object.</li>
          </ul></li>
        <li><i>pseudo-conflict</i> (<image href="../img/SVNSynchronizePseudoConflict9.png"/> icon in
            <i>Name</i> column) - A file is considered to be in <i>pseudo-conflict</i> when it
          contains both incoming and outgoing changes. When incoming and outgoing changes do not
          intersect, an update operation may automatically merge the incoming file content into the
          existing locally one. In this case, the <i>pseudo-conflict</i> marker is removed. This
          marker is used only as a warning that should prevent you to run into a real conflict.</li>
      </ul><note>
        <ul>
          <li>A conflicting resource cannot be committed to repository. You have to resolve it
            first, by using <uicontrol>Mark Resolved</uicontrol> action (after manually
            editing/merging file contents) or by using <uicontrol>Mark as Merged</uicontrol> action
            (for pseudo-conflicts).</li>
          <li><image href="../img/SynchronizeRealConflict.png"/> and <image
              href="../img/SVNSynchronizePseudoConflict9.png"/> icons are presented only when one of
            the following view modes is selected: <uicontrol>Modified</uicontrol>,
              <uicontrol>Incoming</uicontrol>, <uicontrol>Outgoing</uicontrol>,
              <uicontrol>Conflicts</uicontrol>.</li>
          <li>The <image href="../img/SVNSynchronizePseudoConflict9.png"/> icon is used also for
            folders to signal that they contain a file in real conflict or pseudo-conflict
            state.</li>
        </ul>
      </note></p>
