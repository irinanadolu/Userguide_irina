  <body>
    <p>When you click on a file attached to a task in the <xref
        href="content_fusion_task_details.dita"><i>Task Details</i> page</xref>, that particular
      file is opened in the <ph keyref="product"/> visual editor. This is where <b>Reviewers</b> can
      proofread, propose changes, and add comments in the files. The <b>Content Author</b> can also
      use this visual editor to view or manage the proposed changes and comments, or to make their
      own changes. For example, the <b>Content Author</b> can accept or reject changes proposed by
        <b>Reviewers</b>, add new comments, reply to existing comments, or edit the document
      directly in the browser interface.</p>
    <p>The <ph keyref="product"/> visual editor includes a variety of panes, components, and
      features. The main editing pane and many of the components and features inherit functionality
      from <xref href="https://www.oxygenxml.com/xml_web_author.html" format="html" scope="external"
          ><b>Oxygen XML Web Author</b></xref>.</p>

    </p>
    <section id="task_files_panel">
      <title>Left-Side Activity Stream Panel</title>
      <p>The resizable left panel lists all the files and messages that are attached to the task.
        You can switch files simply by clicking on the file in this left panel. You can use the
          <uicontrol>Add Message</uicontrol> button to add a new message for the <b>Content
          Author</b> or other <b>Reviewers</b> and the <uicontrol>Finalize Review</uicontrol> button
        can be used to indicate that you are <xref href="finishing_tasks.dita#finishing_tasks"
          >finished reviewing all files</xref>. Keep in mind that all messages in this panel are
        attached to the task and not to individual files (to annotate individual files, use the
          <xref href="#making_changes_to_uploaded_files/add-comment" format="dita"><uicontrol>Add
            Comment</uicontrol> button</xref> in the editor). All files attached to the task should
        be reviewed before using the <uicontrol>Finalize Review</uicontrol> button.</p>
      <p>For DITA projects, if the <b>Content Author</b> specified a context DITA map, this panel
        shows the hierarchy of all the attached files as they appear in the specified DITA map. The
        topic title hierarchy from the DITA map is also displayed underneath each topic and if part
        of it is not shown, you can hover over it to see the entire title hierarchy in a
        tooltip.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="visual_editor">
      <title>Main Editing Pane</title>
      <p>This editor allows you to review and edit content similar to other common online editors.
        In most cases, the <term>tracked changes</term> feature will always be on so you and the
          <b>Content Author</b> can see exactly what was changed and the <b>Content Author</b> will
        be able to easily accept or reject the changes.</p>
      <p>The visual editor includes a variety of useful editing features:<ul id="ul_zb4_zcx_4jb" irina="irina">
          <li><b>Smart Paste</b> - When you use copy/paste actions, the built-in <term>Smart
              Paste</term> feature preserves certain style and structure information.</li>
          <li><b>Contextual Menu Actions</b> - The contextual menu offers some editing actions that
            are specific to the type of document you are working with, depending on the specific
            location within the document.</li>
          <li><b>Content Completion Assistant</b> - The <term>Content Completion Assistant</term>
            helps you insert valid XML content. It offers a list of elements, attributes, attribute
            values, and other options that are valid at the current location. It tries to determine
            the most logical choice in the current editing context and displays that proposal at the
            beginning of the list. The feature is activated when you press
                <uicontrol><shortcut>Enter</shortcut></uicontrol> on your keyboard and you can
            navigate through the list of proposals by using the
              <uicontrol><shortcut>Up</shortcut></uicontrol> and
                <uicontrol><shortcut>Down</shortcut></uicontrol> arrow keys and to insert the
            selection, simply press <uicontrol><shortcut>Enter</shortcut></uicontrol> again.</li>
          <li><b>Breadcrumb</b> - The main editing pane includes a <i>breadcrumb</i> stripe that
            shows the hierarchical XML structure of the current document, from the document root to
            the current element. By default, it is displayed at the bottom of the main editing area.
            You can click the double arrow button (<image href="../img/BreadcrumbTop16.png"
              id="image_cd5_1cx_4jb"/>) on the right side of the breadcrumb to move it to the top.
            The last element listed in the <term>breadcrumb</term> is the element at the current
            cursor position. Clicking an element from the <term>breadcrumb</term> selects the entire
            element in the editor area.</li>
          <li><b>Automatic Spell Checking</b> - The visual editor automatically checks for spelling
            errors when a document is loaded and every time a modification is made in the document.
            Words that are detected as spelling errors are underlined with a jagged red line. If you
            right-click on the word, you are presented with a list of suggestions that you can
            select from to replace the word and an <uicontrol>Ignore</uicontrol> option.</li>
        </ul></p>

    <section id="toolbar_actions">
      <title>Toolbar Actions</title>
      <p>The editor also includes a toolbar with some common actions as well as others that are
        specific to the type of document (framework). Most <b>Reviewers</b> will only be interested
        in the buttons located in the first two sections of toolbar actions. These actions
        include:</p>

        to individual files.</p>
