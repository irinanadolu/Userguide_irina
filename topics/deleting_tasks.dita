    <p>As the <b>Content Author</b>, it is recommended that you always delete tasks that have been
      merged so that you do not accidentally merge them again since that could create some
      complicated conflicts. There are two ways to delete a task:<ul>
        <li>In the <uicontrol>Content Fusion Tasks Manager</uicontrol> view, hover over the task you
          want to delete and click the <uicontrol>Delete Task</uicontrol> link.</li>
        <li>Open the task in the <ph keyref="product"/> interface and select <menucascade>
            <uicontrol>MORE</uicontrol>
            <uicontrol>Delete</uicontrol>
          </menucascade>.</li>
      </ul></p>
    <p><b>Result:</b> In both cases, this will delete the task from the <ph keyref="product"/>
      server and the <uicontrol>Content Fusion Tasks Manager</uicontrol> view.</p>
