  <title>Page Breaks Between Named Pages</title>
  <body>
    <p>A page break will be created each time there is a change in the <codeph>page</codeph>
      property associated to the elements in a sequence. Suppose that you have a sequence of
      <xmlelement>div</xmlelement> elements, one of them associated with a "cover" page, and others with a
      "chapter" page:</p>
    <codeblock outputclass="language-css">div.cover {
    page: cover;
}

div.chapter {
    page: chapter;
}</codeblock>
    <p>The XML document:</p>
    <codeblock outputclass="language-xml">...
&lt;div class="cover"> Welcome to the User Guide... &lt;/div>
&lt;div class="chapter"> Here are the details... &lt;/div>
&lt;div class="chapter"> Here are some more details... &lt;/div></codeblock>
    <p>In this example, there will be a forced page break between the first <xmlelement>div</xmlelement>
      (associated to the "cover" page) and the second because of the <codeph>page</codeph>
      change.</p>
    <p>The next two <xmlelement>div</xmlelement> elements are not separated by page breaks because they have
      the same <codeph>page</codeph> name ("chapter") and they are grouped in the same page
      sequence. If you want to style the first page from that sequence in a different way, the
      selector:<codeblock outputclass="language-css">@page content:first{
  background-color: yellow;
}</codeblock>will
      apply to the first page from the first "chapter" <xmlelement>div</xmlelement>.</p>
    <p>Suppose you want each of the chapters to start a new page sequence, with the first page
      colored in yellow. To do so, you must declare a new sequence start on the <xmlelement>div</xmlelement>
      element. This can be done using the extension property
      <codeph>-oxy-page-group</codeph>:<codeblock outputclass="language-css">div.chapter {
  page: chapter;
  -oxy-page-group:start;
}</codeblock></p>
