    <p>The content author is supported by a variety of <xref keyref="glossentry_dockable"
          ><term>dockable</term></xref> helper views that are displayed by default when editing in
        <uicontrol>Author</uicontrol> mode. These views are automatically synchronized with the
      current editing context of the editor panel. They present additional information about this
      context thus helping the author to see quickly the current location in the overall document
      structure and the available editing options.</p>
    <p>There is also a large selection of additional useful views available in the <menucascade>
        <uicontrol>Window</uicontrol>
        <uicontrol>Show View</uicontrol>
      </menucascade> menu. This section presents some of the most helpful views for editing in
        <uicontrol>Author</uicontrol> mode.</p>
