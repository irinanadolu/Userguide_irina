    <p>The <b>Oxygen</b> team is dedicated to developing software products that are usable for
      everyone, including those with physical challenges and disabilities. <ph
        keyref="webappProduct"/> has been designed and enhanced to adhere to the <xref
        href="https://www.access-board.gov/guidelines-and-standards/communications-and-it/about-the-ict-refresh/final-rule/text-of-the-standards-and-guidelines"
        format="html" scope="external">U.S. Government Section 508 accessibility standards</xref>
      and the <xref href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/" format="html" scope="external">Web Content
        Accessibility Guidelines
      (WCAG)</xref><?oxy_comment_start author="steven_higgs" timestamp="20190524T084804+0300" comment="Untoggle when we the European compliance has been implemented."?><!--, and the <xref href="https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/301500_301599/301549/02.01.02_60/en_301549v020102p.pdf" format="pdf" scope="external">Harmonised European Standard Accessibility requirements for ICT products and services</xref>--><?oxy_comment_end?>.</p>
    <p>The purpose is to ensure that <ph keyref="webappProduct"/> is accessible and functional for
      all people, including the ability to access the functionality of the application through the
      use of assistive technology, such as screen readers.</p>
    <p>Some of the accessibility features in <ph keyref="webappProduct"/> include:<ul
        id="ul_nv4_mr5_vhb" irina="irina">
        <li>The ability to <xref href="wa-using-the-keyboard.dita">work with Web Author using the
            keyboard</xref>, without the need of a mouse.</li>
        <li>The various UI components and areas within the application (such as dialog boxes and
          views) are accessible to screen readers. Web Author has been tested with NVDA, JAWS, and
          VoiceOver.</li>
        <li>Features (such as change tracking) are interpreted by screen readers.</li>
        <li>An <xref href="webapp-overview.dita#webapp-overview/enable-accessibility"
              ><uicontrol>Enable accessibility optimization</uicontrol> option</xref> that optimizes
          the editor for accessibility and provide more information for screen readers.</li>
        <li>Labels or instructions are provided when content requires user input.</li>
        <li>Numerous common keyboard shortcuts were enabled and additional shortcuts were added (for
          example, on Windows, <uicontrol><shortcut>Ctrl+F2</shortcut></uicontrol> instructs the
          screen reader to provide more information about an element).</li>
        <li>Navigation through the various UI components is achieved through keyboard commands (for
          example, on Windows, <uicontrol><shortcut>Tab</shortcut></uicontrol>,
              <uicontrol><shortcut>Shift+Tab</shortcut></uicontrol>, arrow keys,
              <uicontrol><shortcut>Enter</shortcut></uicontrol>, space bar, and
              <uicontrol><shortcut>Ctrl+F6</shortcut></uicontrol>/<uicontrol><shortcut>Shift+Ctrl+F6</shortcut></uicontrol>
          navigates through the main regions of the UI).</li>
        <li>Color contrasts are adjusted to comply with the required standards.</li>
        <li>A spell check dialog box (accessed via a toolbar button or
              <uicontrol><shortcut>F7</shortcut></uicontrol>) provides the ability to cycle through
          misspelled words and replace them with the correct
            words.<?oxy_comment_start author="steven_higgs" timestamp="20190524T161635+0300" comment="This note can be deleted when this feature is included in the installation kit. Probably 22.0."?><note>The
            installation kit does not include this feature by default, but it can be enabled by
            installing a <xref href="https://github.com/oxygenxml/web-author-spelling-dialog-plugin"
