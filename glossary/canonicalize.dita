  <glossdef>To <b><term>canonicalize</term></b> something means to convert it to a standard format
    that everyone generally uses. When using the term with regard to XML, it refers to the process
    of converting data that has more than one possible representations into a standardization that
    conforms to the specification of an XML document or document subset. It is helpful for
    applications that require the ability to test whether or not the content of an XML document or
    subset has been changed.</glossdef>
