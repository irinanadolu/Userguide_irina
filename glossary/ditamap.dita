  <glossdef>
    <p>A <b><term>DITA map</term></b> is a component of the DITA <xref keyref="glossentry_framework"
          ><term>framework</term></xref> that provides the means for a hierarchical collection of
      DITA topics that can be processed to form an output. Maps do not contain the content of
      topics, but only references to them. These are known as topic references. Usually, the maps
      are saved on disk or in a CMS with the extension <filepath>.ditamap</filepath>. </p>
    <p>Maps can also contain relationship tables that establish relationships between the topics
      contained within the map. Relationship tables are also used to generate links in your
      published document.</p>
    <p>You can use your map or <xref keyref="glossentry_bookmap"><term>bookmap</term></xref> to
      generate a deliverable using an output type such as XHTML, PDF, HTML Help, or Eclipse
      Help.</p>
