  <glossdef>The word <b><term>dependencies</term></b> in XML documents refers to resources or
    references that are relied upon in a particular scope (e.g. the scope of the entire project or a
    particular DITA map) for a selected resource. This is helpful if you want to see where the
    resource is used or referenced in the entire hierarchy of the project or map. For example, you
    might want to look for the dependencies of an XML document to find all the instances where it is
    referenced throughout the hierarchy of a project or DITA map.</glossdef>
